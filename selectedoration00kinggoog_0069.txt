THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 59

ἕ of four years, afterwards once in five years—the period called

a lustrum—and holding office for eighteen monthS. Their
dutioe were of three kinds: (a) They took the census, which
was a register of the citizens with their families and the amount
of their property, fixed, in accordance with this censuS, the
position of each citizen in his tribe,⁸ class and century, and
filled vacancies in the senate. (b) They had a general over· 57

ordo (§§ 14, 20), or, if a commoner, to a lower class in his tribe,

over the senate. All the praetors had the right to summon
the senate and comitia, and each was attended in the city by two
lictors, without the city by six.

(4) The Tribuni.—The tribunes of the plebs were ten in 61
