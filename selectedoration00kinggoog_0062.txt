age (ἓ 8). Th'at' of 70, when the franchise had been ext-,ended
over all Italy, showed 450,000, ,but probably only those were
counted who presented themselves at Rome for the purpose.
These figures would give a total free population of about 780,000
and 1,350,000 respectively for the area covered by each census.
The census of 28 gave 4,063,000 for all Italy ; but it is a matter
of dispute whether this was the sum of the whole population,
or of those only of military age.

For administrative purposes the citizens were ⁴divided into 25
various groupS, as are those of all civilized communities to-day.
⁶ During the regal period the citizens were divided into thirty
curiae, ‘warda² At a later (republican) period all the people
of the city and adjacent territory were divided according to
locality into tribue, ‘tribeS,’ which in Cicero’s time numbered
thirty-five. At a still later date each tribe was subdivided on a
basis of wealth and age into ten centuriae, ‘centurieS,' making
of course three hundred and fifty centuriae for all the people
possessing the minimum of property required.

Each citizen on being enrolled as such (ἓ 7) was assigned 26
by the censors to his proper tribe and century, and it was
only as a member of such tribe or century that he could exer-
cise that most important of his iura publica (ἓ 2) the ius suffrayii.
That is, each ward, or tribe, or century, was counted as a whole,
its vote being determined, as is the electoral vote of one of our
stateS, by the majority of the individual votes of the citizens who
composed it.

In accordance with this triple division of the⁴ citizens there 27
were three great popular assemblies (comitia, from cum and eo),
known respectively as the Comitia Curiata, Comitia Tributa‚
and Comitia Centuriam. The word comitia is plural in Latin,
but is used by English writers as a singular also, equivalent to
assembly.
