remained in the city, having charge of the treasury (aerarium)
and' of the laWS, decrees of the senate and other archives which
were deposited there for safe keeping. They kept the state
accountS, received the taxeS, and paid out moneys to the
proper officers on order of the senate. Four others were 67
assigned to points in Italy where the public revenues required
the presence of state agents, Others accompanied the gen-
erals in the field as pay and quarter-masterS, and the rest were
sent to the provinceS, where their duties resembled those of
the city quaestors to whom they rendered their accounts.

Petty magistrates—Resides these important magistrates68
there were several boards of inferior magistrates charged with
less extensive duties and elected in the comitia tributa. There
was a Board of Ten, plebeian lawyers who advised the tribunes ;

a Board of Three, who looked after prisons and executions3
another Board of Three, who superintended the coinage; a
Board of Four, who, under the censors and aedileS, cared for
the streets of the city ; and a Board of Two, who looked after 69
the roads outside of the city. There were also four Praefecti,
‘circuit judgeS,' who represented the praetor in Campania.

title Viqintiseaeviri, ‘Board of Twenty-six.' .

maintained at public expense. Chief among these were the
Scribae, ‘clerks,' whole bureaus of whom were kept employed by
the senate and all the higher magistrates They were so
numerous and important that they were called collectively
the Ordo Scribarum. The Lici-ores were the attendants of the 71
dictatorS, consuls and praet ·s, executed their orders when
force was required, cleared a way for them through the streets,
and dispersed disorderly crowds that impeded public business,
The Viatores had similar duties and were the attendants
especially of the tribunes. PraeconeS, ‘crierS,' were employed
