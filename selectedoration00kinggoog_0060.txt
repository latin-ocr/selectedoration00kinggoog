50 INTRODUCTION

a curule magistrate, was the patent of nobility‚ and all descen-
dants of curule magistrates were, therefore, nobles (nobiles).
The dignity of a noble depended upon the number of such
masks that he could display.

Ordo Senatoriua—Sulla had increased the number of senators 14
from 300 to 600 life-members, and had chosen the new members
from ex-curule magistrates. He also provided that all holders
of curule officeS‚ or even of the quaestorship‚ should be ipso

of the senate over the elections that it was able virtually to
restrict the holding of office to persons of its own choice. The
candidates supported by the senators were naturally members
of their own families (therefore nobles), and so it came about
that the Senatorial Order and the Nobility were one and the

themselves. In the second place there were always nobles who 17
had not been elected to office, and were not therefore of. the
senatorial order. But men of these two classes were compara-
tively so few in number that for practical purposes we may
. consider the Nobilitas and the Ordo Senatorius as identical.
The senators wore as insi9nia the tunica laticlavia (with a broad
purple stripe), and those who had also held curule magis-
tracies wore the mulleu-S, a purple shoe.

speculation to politicS, and had amassed large fortunes by their

had been ill defined though their influence had been considerable.
