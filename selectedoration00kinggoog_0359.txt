ROMAN CORRESPONDENGE 335

should be given: CICERO (or M. C1cnno) C. clansam s. n. (15). Still greater
formality required the descent upon the fathers' side and official titles
(2. 3, 21): M. Tumus M (arei) F (ilius) M (arci) N (epos) C1cnno Im»
(emtor) s. D. C. Gamo L (uei) F (ilio) C (- Gai) N (epoti) CALDO Quanam
(οτ-ἰ). On the other hand in friendly letters the s. n. may become the more 12
cordial Su. (as in the letters to Atticus), or San (uteru) Paulum, or may
be omitted altogether as if too frigid. Then, t00, more or less endearihg
adiectives may be added to the name of the correspondent, as suus (9, 10,
14), sUAv1ss1Mus, nuncmsnms, etc„ or a tender diminutive employed (11),
or the praenomen or nomen (9, 10, 14), may be substituted for the coqnomen
of the writer.

The BODY of the letter does not differ essentially‘from the modern form. 13
The writer, as a rule, plunges abruptly into his subject in the straightfor-
ward fashion peculiar to the Romane. In his official and formal
letters, however, Cicero sometimes uses certain old fashioned phrases that
had once been strictly insisted upon: St vanns nnus nsr, or to a general
in the ,field 81 ‘ru nxnacrrusoun vannus, BENE: ns'r (2), often with the
addition Eoo (or noo omnam) vnum, all indicated by the initial letters
only. The close of the letter is as abrupt as the beginning, though we find
a few stock phrases of leave-taking: VALE or vanarn (9, 10), CURA (or FAC)
υτ νΑιΕΛε (4, 14).

The smn of the letters shows the· ordinary conversational Latin of the 14
refined and polished circles in which the writer moved. The sentences are
much shorter than in literary Latin, the order of words is less studied and
artificial, and the connection is often loose and obscure. Colloquialisms and
ellipses abound, the personal pronouns and such verbs as ayere, esse, facere,
ferre, ire and venire being omitted with great freedom. The pluperfect 15
is often used for the imperfect and perfect, and these in turn for the present
-i.e.‚ the writer projecte himself into the time of the reading of the letter
and describes present actions as past. Exaggerated and pleonastic expres-
sions are especially common, Greek words and phrases are frequently used
(13, 20) just as some persons nowadays interlard English letters with
French and German, and postscripts are not uncommon (11).

IV. SnAmNo and ΟΡΕΝῙΝΟ the Lm'rnn. For sealing the letter thread 16
(linum), wax (cera) and a seal (siynum) were necessary. The seal not
only secured the letter against improper inspection but also attested the
genuineness of those written by the librarii, as autograph signatur-es seem
not to have been thought of. Each man's seal had some device peculiar
to it, and was affixed to all documents which he wished to acknowledge as
his own. The tabellae (ᾗ 4) having been put together face to face, the thread 17
was passed around them and through small holes bored through them, and
was then securely tied. Upon the knot sostened wax was dropped, and
