hand his morals were conspicuously pure. In an age of
corruption and social degeneracy he was always above all

his slaves ; his dealings with the poor and helpless were just
and humane. The lifelong devotion of Atticus and Tiro testifies 3
to his amiable and affectionate nature ; his defense of Roscius,
Sestius and Milo to his courage and loyalty. His tenderness
to his daughter Tullia and his love for his brother Quintus
touch us still. His wealth was acquired honorably, and, is
spent lavishly, was spent on books and villas and works of
