162 ΙΝ CATILINAM ORATIO QUARTA

populi consulentem. Video de istia qui se populares haberi· 10
volunt, abesse non neminem, ne de capite videlicet civium

Romanorum sententiam ferat.

Is et nudius tertius in custo-

15 diam cives Romanos dedit et supplicationem mihi decrevit et
indices hesterno die maximis praemiis adfecit. Iam hoc
nemini dubium est, qui reo custodiam, quaesitori gratulationem,

At vero C. Caesar intellegit legem Semproniam esse de civibus
20 Romanis constitutam ; qui autem rei publicae sit hostiS,
eum civem esse nullo modo posse; denique ipsum latorem

a difference there is;' for another mean-
ing ot the verb cf. l. 1; for its mood
cf. contrahatur, 1. ὃς for tense see on
111. 5. 27. contionatorum: ‘dema-
gogues.'

12, 13. de istis: for case see A. 346,
c: B. 201, 1, e: H. 444; H.-B. 346, e:
for force see Ι. 1. 15; for the form of
attack which Cicero expected that these
demagogues would adopt cf. ΙΙ. 7.
10—12. se populares haberi volunt:
‘pretend that they are regarded as
democrats;' for this sense of volunt cf.
4. 30. non nem-inem: ‘one or more.¹
in sense plural, though treated as a
singular: cf. terat, and Is, 1. 14. de
capite: ‘in a matter of life and death.'
Sometimes caput refers merely to one's
civil statum its special sense here is
shown by the context.

14. sententiam terat: ‘give their
voteS.’ i.e., they were absent to avoid
‘going on record;' there were differences
of opinion among good lawyers regard-
ing the legality oi this trial. is: any
one of those indicated by the indefinite
non neminem. l. 13. nudius tertius
=nunc dies tertius, ‘day before yester-
day' (Dec. 3) by the inclusive reckon-
ing of the Romans.

15-17. dedit. decrevit, adfecit: 'i.e.‚
gave his vote' for these acts (see on
removet, 4. 3, and give the more precise
torm): point out three other instances
in the remainder of the chapter. hoc:
Qssolained by quid . . . iudicarit. qui:

has for its antecedent the unexpressed
subject oi iudicarit. reo: the same
word as rei. 8. 1. quaesitori: the
investigator prosecutor, Cicero.

18. decrerit: principal parts? Cicero
means that the absent senators have
already gone on record by the unan-
imous (ct. ΙΙΙ, 6. 4) decrees of Dec. 3.

19. legem Semproniam: It is not
certain just what this law os Ti. Sem-
pronius Gracchus (2. 20) was, but it
seems to have confirmed the right oi·
appeal granted to citizens by the earlier
leves Porciae and lex Valeria (see on I.
11. 14). Cicero mentions it here in
allusion to portions of Caesar’s speech
because it was the most recent legisla-
tion upon the question before the sen-
ate, and because the fate of its proposer
could be used as an argument against
Caesar. Notice that Roman laws are
described by the nomina of their pro-
posers (cf. our usage in speaking of 'the
Sherman law,' ‘McKinley bil1‚' etc.).

20, 21. qui . . . posse: Here are the
two premises of a syllogism: (1) The
law applies (only) to citizens: (2) these
men are not citizens-the conclusion
being so evident that the orator does
not stop to state it. The weakness ot
Cicero’s argument is this: The question
whether or not the prisoners were ret·
publicae hostes was precisely the point
for a court (not the senate) to decide.
Cicero probably argued in his own mind
that the consessions os Lentulus (111.
