AD QUIRITES ORATIO

Imonuc'ronr Nom. This speech was delivered in a contio, for the
meaning of which see on Ad populum, 11. Title, and Abbott, R. P. 1. 164,
297. One of the most dangerous foreign foes with whom the Romans
had to deal during the last two certuries B. G. was Mithridates VI, king
of Pontus, 120—63. He was brave, energetic, unscrupulous and ambitione.
By a long struggle he extended his kingdom until it included the territory
on the eastern shore of the‘Black Sea. Toward the beginning of the first
century B. C. he turned his attention to western Asia Minor, part of
‚which had become a Roman province in 129. Various disputes over the
kingship of Bithynia, Paphlagonia and Cappadocia furnished Mithridates
a pretext for occupying western Asia Minor, after which he gave orders
for a general massacre of all Italians residing there. At least 80‚000
perished. The Romans, who had previously determined upon active
measures to expel Mithridates, were now thoroughly aroused and pro-
ceeded to the prosecution of the First Mithridatio War in 88. The com-
mand of their armies was intrusted to L. Cornelius Sulla. His campaigns
were successful, and in 84 Mithridates was compelled to sue for peace,
to give up 80 warships and all territory except his kingdom of Pontus,
and to pay the Romans 3‚000 talents. In 83 Sulla sailed to Italy, leaving
two legions in Asia under Licinius Murena. Murena provoked Mithridates
to a war fruitless for both sides, known as the Second Mithridatio War,
83—81. A period of comparative peace followed until 7 4, when Mithridates
and his son-in-law Tigranes, king of Armenia, began the Third Mithridatio
War, L. Licinius Lucullus, the Roman commander, gained many important
victories, but in 68 his wearied and discontented soldiers refused to con-
tinue a war which, as they thought, only served the ambition of their
general. With his troops he passed the winter at Nisibis in Mesopo-
tamia, where they broke out in open mutiny. Encouraged by these
