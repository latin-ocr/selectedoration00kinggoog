utrique ad urbem imperatores erant, inpediti, ne triumpharent,
ιο. calumnia paucorum, quibus omnia honesta atque inhonesta
vendere mos erat), sed praetores Q. Pompeius Rufus Capuam,
Q. Metellus Celer in agrum Picenum, eisque permissum, uti pro
tempore atque periculo exercitum conpararent. Ad hoc, siquis
indicavisset de conjuratione, quae contra rem publicam facta
15 erat, praemium servo libertatem et sestertia centum, libero
inpunitatem eius rei et sestertia ducenta, itemque decrevere,
uti gladiatoriae familiae Capuam et in cetera municipia distribu-
erentur pro cuiusque opibus, Romae per totam urbem vigiliae
haberentur eisque minores magistratus praeessent.

pepererat, repente omnis tristitia invasit: festinare trepidare,

⁸ near Rome! As imperatores they could
not enter the city without forfeiting their
imperium. Each ot these men claimed
a triumph ior his services in the prov·
inces. and clung to his imperium till the
triumph should be granted or finally re·
rused (cf. Verr. 15. 18). impediti ne
triumpharent: ‘prevented trom tri-
umphing' (A. 558. b; Β. 295, 3:11. 5⁶63
H.-B. 502, 3, b). Pompey claimed that
under the Gabinlan law these men were
placed under his authority (so that their
campaigns were conducted under his
auspicia), and were not entitled to the
honor of a triumph.

10. 11. paucorum: the senatorial
oligarchy; but this is not strictly true.
as the oligarchs had not approved the
grants of power to Pompey in 67 and
66. and would not have supported his
pretensions. venderet 'sell’ ror bribes

the neuter scamium denoted 1,000
sestertii, and was employed as the unit
of moderate sums of money. The
amount here is between uoco and
85,000 (see vocab). The amount to be
given a lreeman was just double this
(ducenta).

16. eius roi: his part in the con-
spiracy: the gen. 1ε objective.

17. fiammae: ' ‘schools' ot gladi-
aton, under training by a lanista. As
their condition was so bad that they
had nothing to lose by rebellion it was
dangerous to keep them at Rome in
large numbers, and so it was proposed
to scatter them, under guard, in remote
places.
