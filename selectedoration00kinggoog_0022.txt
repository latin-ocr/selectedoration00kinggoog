art, not on the gratification of sshe meaner passionS. His
domestic relations became unhappy.³ After thirty years of
married life he divorced Terentia. He married a young heiress
and divorced her too. The sufferings of Tullia caused him the
keenest sorrow, and his only son was dissipated and incapable.
He found distraction, however, in his studies, and consolation
in philosophy. γ

His Political career.-Cicero's political career began with 4
his quaestorship in Sicily in 75. At the earliest legal age he
became aedile (69) and praetor (66). In 63 he was consul, and
suppressed the conspiracy of Catiline. In 58 he was exiled,
but was soon recalled. During the so-called first triumvirate
he was kept in the background‚ neglected alike by friends and
foes, During the civil war (49-45), after long and anxious
hesitation, he espoused the cause of Pompey against Caesar,
but finaHy was reconciled to the latter and lived on friendly
terms with him until his assassination. He took no part in the
plot against ,Caesar's life, yet openly exulted in the deed of the
conspiratorS. For a short, time his early vigor reasserted itself,
and he headed the patriotic party against the new triumvirate.
When the cause of the republic was finally lost he was among
the first to fall victim to the proscription. He was.. murdered
in 43 at the age of 63. ’

Cicero was a patriot—as a politician he was a failure. He 5
seemed unable to comprehend the tendencies of the times», the
fickleness of the people, the rottenness of the aristocracy, the
insufficiency of the old constitution. He was short-sighted,
hesitating, by turns lenient to weakness and harsh to cruelty.
He was easily swayed by circumstanceS, and often the tool of
unscrupulous men. He lacked the far-seeing statesmanship,
sels-control and resolute determination that gave Caesar the
victory, and the disinterestedness of purpose and‘ stubbornness
,of will that made Cato great in defeat. But Augustus said of
him, ‘He loved his ο country.' His motives were pure, his
integrity unimpeached, and he laid down his life for the republic.
