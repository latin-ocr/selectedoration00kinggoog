thing when he chose, and weave a web of sophistry almost impos-
sible to disentangle. What he wished to make clear he could
put in the simplest, plainest, most forcible way, and he ,generally
did it in the shortest sentences He could be humorous‚ sarcas- 9
tic, pathetic, ironical, satirical, and when he was malignant
his mouth was most foul and his bite most venomous. His
orations are distinguished by variety and rapid change of senti-

full and sweet, his figure tall, graceful and impressive. He
possessed a wonderful influence over the senses and feelings
of his hearers, and when other counsel were associated with
him it was usual for Cicero to be the· last to address the jury.
By universal consent he is placed side by side with DemostheneS,
or at least close after him. He surpassed the great Attio orator

and despair of the greatest oratorS. Petrarch and ErasmuS,
Chatham and Burke, Webster‚ Everett and Choate, all have
felt and owned the powerful influence of his example.

We know of over one hundred orations which he delivered;
fifty-seven have been preserved entire, some twenty others in
a fragmentary condition. We do not have them, however,
in the precise form in which they were delivered, because it was
his custom to prepare his speeches for publication by removing
the parts of less permanent interest, and revising the rest.

his own merits to recommend him to the people, he devoted
himself with all his might to the study of oratory, which was
