THE ROMAN COMMoN WEALTH · ’ 55

comitia it could be countermanded by any magistrate equal or
superior in authority to the· one appointing it. Even after
the voting had begun it had to be suspended if lightning was
seen, or if a storm arose, or if any one present had an epileptic
fit, or if a tribune of the people interposed, or if night came on

about matters in which he or they might be interested. He43
could address them himself or give any one else the right to
speak. Th‘ese assemblies had no powers of any kind, no
resolutions were adopted, no voting was done, no debate was
allowed3 but they were the one means of acquainting the public,
citizens and slaves and foreignerS, with public events before
