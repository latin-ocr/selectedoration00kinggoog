interfectus est propter quasdam seditionum suspiciones C.
GracchuS‚ clarissimo patre, avo, maioribus, occisus est cum

liberis M. Fulvius consularis,

Simili senatus consulto C. Mario

et L. Valerio consulibus est permissa res publica 3 num unum
diem postea L. Saturninum tribunum pl. et C. Servilium prae-
torem mors ac rei publicae poena remorata est? At nos vice-

Habemus enim huiusce modi senatus consultum, verum

2. l. quondam: In 121 Gaius Grac-
chuS, tribune 123-122, had carried a
series of measures tend1ng to overthrow
the power of the senate. The senate took
advantage oi a riot to pass the consul-
tum ultimum (Abbott‚ R. P. 1. 5287),
arming L. Opimius. the one consul then
at Rome, against the revolutionists.
Gracchus himself, his chief supportet
M. Fulvius Flaccus, with the latter's
young son and three thousand of their
followers, were killed.

2. quid detrimenti: ‘any harm'
(lit... ‘anything of harm'). For indefi-
nIte force of quid see A. 149, ὸς Β. 91;
H. 186: H.'-B. 276, 1.

4. clarissimo patres abl. of quality.
The construction is slightly irregular.
Such an abl.. or equivalent gen„ or adj„
usually modifies a generic noun (homo,
vir) in apposition to the proper name:
but the generic noun is often omitted as
here. The whole phrase means ‘oi
most illustrious ancestry.² occisus est:
Note the position of this verb and the
preceding in their respective clauses,
gaining emphasis by inversion. The
same is true of decrevit. l. 1.

5. liberis: Really but one son was
killed in the riot‚ and the plural is used
by rhetorical exaggeration, as illa. 1. 24.
0. Mario: What does C. stand for?
(A. 108, ος B. 3733 H. 354, 6: H.-B. 678,
3). Write the full name. Mario et
Valerio: During their consulship (100)

by L. Saturninus‘and C. Glaucia. In
tear ot violence the senate passed the
consultum ultimum: and. in the conflict
that followed, Saturninus and his fol-
lowers were stoned to death in the
senate house.

7. p1.==pzebis.

8. more ao rei p. poena: ‘the
death penalty fixed by the State! Name
the grammatical figure. and quote an
illustration from 51. rei publicae:
subjective gen.; the Romans looked upon
all punishments (originally fines) as be-
longing to the injured party, to whom
‘the fines were in early times given as
recompensa or damages. remorata
ent: ‘caused to wait.’ The criminal is
represented as always expecting punish-
ment, and waiting ior it to overtake
him. The sentence in brief means, ‘The
nation's vengeance did not keep Satur-
ninus and Servilius in suspense. did itr’
vicesimumz in round numbers. Find
the exact number (Oct. 22—Nov. 8).
remembering that the Romans counted
in the starting-point.

9. diem: as in 1. 7 (Α. 423, 2ς
Β. 181; H. 417: H.-B. 387 and 11).
hebescere aciem: The authority
conterred by the senatus consultum
is spoken of as a sword whose edge
is growing dull from disuse. The
same figure is continued in moino,
l. 11.

10. 11. huiusce modi: A. 345. a: B.

revolutionary measures were proposed 203.1;H. 440.3; H.-B..-·355. For the form
