ORATIO IN CATILINAM TERTIA

ιο consulibus facta sunt, ut haec, quae nunc fiunt, canere di
inmortales viderentur, hoc certe, quod sum dicturus, neque

praetermittendum neque relinquendum est.

memoria tenetis Cotta et Torquato consulibus complures in
Capitolio res de caelo esse percussas, cum et simulacra deorum
15 depulsa sunt et statuae veterum hominum deiectae et legum
aera liquefacta et tactus etiam ille, qui hanc urbem condidit,
Romulus, quem inauratum in Capitolio parvum atque lactentem
uberibus lupinis inhiantem fuisse meministis. Quo quidem
tempore cum haruspices ex tota Etruria convenissent, caedes

20 atque incendia et legum interitum et bellum civile· ac domesti-

cum et totius urbis atque imperii occasum adpropinquare
dixerunt, nisi di inmortales omni ratione placati suo numine

prope fata ipsa flexissent.

10-12. canere-praedicere. ‘teretem’
a meaning derived from the lit. ‘sing'
from the fact that the seers anciently
uttered their prophecies in verse. prae-
termittendum. relinquendum: both
verbs mean ‘to pass over.’ the former
by negligence, ‘overlook.’ the latter on
purpose, ‘leave unmentioned!

13, 14. cotta et 'torquato consuli-
bus: see Chronological Table, B. C. 65.
When the names oi! the consuls are put
in the abl. abs. to fix the year they
are always connected by a conjunction
when the praenomina are not given (e.g.,
Lepido et Τααο, 1. 8. 21); when the
praenomina are given the conjunction is
regularly omitted. de caelo: the reg·
ular phrase ior lightnings and other
supernatural manifestationS.

15-18. veterum: as in 11. ⁹. 28:
is this the proper meaning oi' the word?
lecum tera: ‘the brazen tablets oi!
the laws,' regularly kept in temples.
especially in that of Saturn, called
the aerarium (see on Ι. 211). Inwhose
keeping were they? me . . . Romu-
lus: seeon 1. 12: the god is here put
ior the statue. quem . . . inhiantem:
euch representations ot the infant Rom-
ulus and his nurse must have been

Itaque illorum responsis tum et 20

common. In the Capitoline Museum at
Rome there is a bronze figure oi a wolf
giving suck to the twins Romulus and
Remus. which Mommsen thinks is iden-
tical with the one mentioned here. ube-
ribus: dat. with compound. tuine
meministin: Both the present and
perfect infinitive are used with memini,
and as all remembered actions are past.
it is evident that the ordinary rules for
the tenses do not apply. If the person
who remembers was an eyewitness ot
the fact remembered, he uses either the
present (Ι. 8. 8). or the perfect (as
here): ii' he was not an eyewitness he
uses the perfect.

19. haruspices: ci. 4. 15. They
were frequently summoned by the sen·
ate to explain such prodigies as these,
in order to quiet the superstitious tears
of the ignorant multitude.

22, 23. Betore nisi . . . flexissent is
an ellipsis ot d ventura esse, as apodosis.
Here. as often (e.g. 8. 13), the sub-
junctive pluperfect stands tor the indic-
ative future perfect in the direct torm.
What the haruspices said was: caedes
. . . appropinquant, d venient nim· dt·
. . . rata flexerint. omni ratione: ‘ln
every way,’ ‘entirely ' prope: (¹-
