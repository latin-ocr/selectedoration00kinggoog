A Roman vovet-nor and his province.

Innonucvronr N orn: written to
Atticus, at Rome, from some point on
the road from Ephesus (where Cicero had
lauded) to Tarsus, capital ot his prov-
ince. As we know from 1v. 11. 2,
Ep. 8. Sal. (see notes), he had yielded
his right to a proconsulship in 62 to
his colleague Antony. Ten years later,
owing to a new law proposed by Pom-
pey which required an interval ot five
years between a man's consulship and
his proconsulship, there was a dearth
ot new material tor provincial governors,
and Cicero, much against his will, was
obliged to go as proconsul to Cilicia.
nis term extended just a year from
July 31, 51; but his leisurely mode ot

travel consumed so much time that he
was absent from Italy a full eighteen
months (May, 51, to November, 50),
and from Rome till the beginning of 49.
This letter describes some of the condi-
tions that met him as he entered his
province. His predecessor had been
Appius Claudius Pulcher (brother of the
Clodius who had brought about Cicero's
exile). who apparently had used his
position as a means of personal enrich-
ment-as was the common practice ot
Roman governors. Cicero's year in
Cilicia was a striking exception.
