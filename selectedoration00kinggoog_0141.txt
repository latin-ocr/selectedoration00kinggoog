CAP. ιο, §g 21-23

genus est parricidarum, sicariorum, denique omnium facinoro-
sorum. Quos ego a Catilina non revoco 3 nam neque ab 00
15 divelli possunt et pereant sane in latrocinio, quoniam sunt ita
multi, ut eos carcer capere non possit. Postremum autem
genus est non solum numero, verum etiam genere ipso atq⁶ue
vita, quod proprium Catilinae aet, de eius dilectu, immo vero
de complexu eius ac sins13 quos pexo capillo nitidos aut inberbis

zo aut bene barbatos videtis, manicatis et talaribus tunicis,

velis amictGS, non togis; quorum omnis industria vitae et vigi-

landi labor in antelucanis cenis expromitur. In his gregibus 23

omnes aleatores omnes adulteri, omnes inpuri inpudicique
versantur. Hi pueri tam lepidi ac delicati non solum amare

25 et amari neque saltare et cantare, sed etiam sicas vibrare et

spargere venena didicerunt. Qui nisi exeunt, nisi pereunt,
etiamsi Catilina perierit, scitote hoc in re publica seminarium

vonna men—oood n‘ddance to both!

15. et pereant: ‘and (Ι say this)
let them.' etc.: the et is correlative to
nme (—et non); and, as unlike con-
structione cannot be connected by co-
ordinate conjunctions, we must assume
a slight ellipsis (see on 2. 4; ὅ. 1; 1.
Β. 33). sane: 101·οο here? See 0111. 1.

16. career: ‘the prison‚’ not ‘a
prison! There was at this time but
one prison at Rome, a part 01 which,
called Tullianum, served for the execu-
tion 01 sentences 01 death, the rest 101·
temporary detention until sentence was
pronounced. The imprisonment 01 free
men as a punishment was absolutely
unknown at Rome (see on I. 8. 13).
Postremum, etc.: ‘The last class is
iast‚' etc. -

17-20. genere: ‘in kind,’ ‘rankz'
give examples from 5520-22 01 aeuus

tion. proprium catilinae: ‘Cati-
line's own;' case? See 011 Ῑ. ὅ. 23.

12. What other phrase might have .

been employed? See on 1. 2. 19. pexo
(pedo) capillo: ‘ abl. 01 quality (so

tunicis, 20), equivalent to an adjective

these adjectives denote roppish peculi-
arities unbecoming the Roman char-
aeter. inberbis aut beno bai-baton
‘without (a sign of) heard, or heavily

bearded.' The tormer was due to their .

effeminacy‚ in consequence 01 thch
they would be 01 little use 111 wariare.
The heavy beard was a mark 01 affecta-
tion in Cicero's time, as the Romans
were accustomed to shave the beard
first on their twenty-first birthday. and
to let it grow afterwards only as a sign

the correct tunic was short and 010ον0-
less.

21. velis. etc.: ‘wrapped in sails, not
togas;' i.e.. these fops affected togas 01
unusual wuith, which gave them the
appearance 01 ships under 11111 sall.
