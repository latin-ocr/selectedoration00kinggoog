ROMAN CORRESPONDENCE

I. Snnnmo Lan-nas. The Romans had no public postal service. §r
Official dispatches were carried by special messengers (statores), and‘ to
these the subject communities had to furnish horses, carts and vessels on
demand. Private letters were usually delivered by slaves (tabellarii) of
the correspondents. For long distances, especially beyond scas, such ser-
vice was very expensive, and, except for the most urgent matters, recourse
was had to travelers and traders going in the desired direction. Persons
intending to travel notified their friends of their departure in time for
letters ιο be written, and also carried letters, if requested‚ for entire
strangers.

There was, of course, great danger that letters carried thus might be 2
lost or might fall into the wrong hands. lt was customary, therefore,
to send a copy of the letter (litterae eodem [or uno] exemplo), or at least an
abstract of its contents‚ by another person, and the meaning was often
disguised by the use of fictitious names understood by the correspondents
only, or by employing regular cipher codes.

The time made by letters carried under such circumstances is remarkable. 3
The tabellarii traveled from forty to fifty miles a day in carts‚ and ·from
twenty-six ιο twenty-seven on foot. Under favorable conditione much
better time was possible: a letter could go from Rome to Brundisium
(three hundred and seventy mill. pase.) in five days, thence on to Dyrrha-
chium in five more, reaching Athens in twenty-one days from its departure;
and letters from Caesar in Britain reached Cicero in Rome in from twenty-
seven to thirty-four days. In the time of Washington a month was the
usual time for a letter to take in going from the Eastem to the Southern
States in winter.

II. Wm‘rmo Mammas. For ordinary brief communications the 1
Romans used tablets (tabellae) made of firwood or ivory. These were of
various sizes‚ fastened together in sets ef two or more by wire hinges. The
inner faces were slightly hollowed out, and the depression was nearly filled
with wax, so as to leave a raised rim about the edges. Upon the wax
letters were traced with an ivory or metal tool (stilus, yraphium) having
one end pointed like a pencil for writing‚ and the other flat, like a paper-
eumer, for smoothing the wax. With this flat end mistakes could be cor-
rected, or the whole letter erased and the tabellae prepared for use on
other occasions.
