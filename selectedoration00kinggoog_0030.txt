to get place and power by the forms of laW, even if his methods
were violent and unscrupulous.

His Second attempt-Agma in 65 Catiline's candidacy 26

’ υ was defeated by prosecution for misgovernment. In 64 he
was actively supported by the more radical democratS, the
influence of Caesar and Crassus being secretly but no less
effectively exerted for him. Besides Catiline and Cicero there
were five candidates, Of these the most promising was Gaius
Antonius Hybrida, who in character and antecedents strongly
resembled Catiline. To him Catiline attached himself, and
both resolved to leave untried no means of canvassing‚ lawful
or unlawful, to defeat Cicero—of the other candidates they
had no fearS. Catiline found friends to assist him with their
money and credit in the purchase of voteS, and at the expense
of other friends shows of gladiators were promised the people
in his name. Finally‚ in June, Catiline called together his 27
trusted adherents and laid before them his plans and the means
of executing them. To the ambitious he promised high posi·-
tions in the state, to the bankrupt complete or partial relief
by legislation, to all alike the rich spoil of an unscrupulous
administration and the plunder of the provinces, All was con-
ditioned of course upon his success in the election of the follow-
ing month; and so, after ratifying their engagements with the
most fearful oaths (it is said that they pledged each other in
wine mixed with human blood), they separated to work, each
in his own way, for the election of Catiline and Antony. “

Οἰοοτοέ Glaucea—While Catiline was indulging in ‚the 28
most confident hopeS, the prospects of Cicero were by no
means bright. He could count certainly upon the support
of the knights only—the order to which his own family
belonged. The nobles despised him as a homo novuS, hated
him for his attacks upon them in his speeches against Verres
and for the Manilian law, and feared that in the future he
might work in the interests of the democratS, and further
the ambitious designs of Pompey.
