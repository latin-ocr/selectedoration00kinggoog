LIFE OF CICERO 19

envoys from Africa had appeared before the senate to present
' ‚ complaints about the scandalous oppression of which he had
'- been guilty 3 hence, threatened with a prosecution for mis-

ι .. 'l'he (so-called) Pirst conspiratum—The candidates elected 23
μ. ,1 for 65 after Catiline's withdrawal were Publius Autronius
ετ.- Paetus and Publius Cornelius Sulla, and they were immediately
brought to trial on the charge of bribery, were convicted and
deposed. In their places were elected the rival candidateS,
, Lucius Aurelius Cotta and Lucius Manlius Torquatus. Autro-

and Sulla in their disappointment, and was afterwards made
their scapegoat when their sins were discovered. In fact,
it became quite the usual thing at Rome to ascribe to Catiline
all unfathered crimes and outrages. It is at least significant
that after the failure of the plot he went on with his plans
