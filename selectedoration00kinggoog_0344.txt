M. TULL'I' CICERONIS

IN M. ANTONIUM ORATIO

PHILIPPICA QUA'RTA

The avowed purpose of the conspirators, headed hy Brutus and Cassius,
ἄη· assassinating Caesar was the restoration of the republic, and Cicero seems
nn have approved the act as a means to that end. It soon became evident,
ἡ owever, that such hope was futile. Mark Antony, one of Caesar’s favorite
lieutenants and consul with him for the year 44, came to the front as his
avenger. The leaders of ⁰the conspiracy fled from the city, and the prob-
ability grew strong that Caesar's powers would be assumed by Antony.

Cicero watched the progress of events with disappointment and grief

and would have left Italy had he not'been prevented by a storm from sail- ³

ing. He returned to Rome in August, 44. Antony’s behavior became
intolerable, and Sept. 2 Cicero delivered in the senate the first of a series
of fourteen speecheso against the consul’s assumptions. From their vigor-
ous invective, reminding their hearers of Demosthenes' famous denun-
ciatione of king Philip of Macedon, these fourteen orations have always
been called ‘Philippics.’ The second was composed in reply to a speech oi
Antony’s, but probably never was delivered.

Antony soon left Rome to complete the organization of his army. Mean-
time Octavian, the young heir of the dictator, appeared to side with the
senate against Antony, enlisting a force of Caesar’s veterans. Two legions
(quarta et Martia) brought from Greece by Antony deserted him and joined
Octavian. On Dec. 20 the senate met--called, in the absence of both con-
suls, by the tribunes of the people, headed by M. Servilius, Cicero spoke
(the third Philippic), closing with these propositions: (1) The consuls
elect, Hirtius and Pansa, soon to take their office, were empoweoeed to gufld
the senate in a meeting to be held J an. 1, 435 (2) D. Brutus was commended
for his loyalty and directed to retain his province (cisalpine Gaul) till the
senate should name his successor; (3) Octavian was commended, as were
the two legions which had gone to him from Antony.
