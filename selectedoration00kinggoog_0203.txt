CAP. 2-4‚ §g 6-9 183

Etenim adhuc ita nostri cum illo rege contenderunt imperatore&
ut ab illo insignia victoriae, non victoriam reportarent. Trium· 8
phavit L. Sulla, triumphavit L. Murena de Mithridate, duo for-

15 tissimi viri et summi imperatoreS, sed ita triumpharunt, ut ille
pulsus superatusque regnaret. Verum tamen illis imperato-
ribus laus est tribuenda, quod egerunt, venia danda, quod reli-
querunt, propterea quod ab eo bello Sullam in Italiam res
publica, Murenam Sulla revocavit.

4. Mithridates autem omne reliquum tempus non ad obli-9
vionem veteris belli, sed ad comparationem novi contulit; qui
postea, cum maximas aedificasset ornassetque classes exer-
citusque permagnos quibuscumque ex gentibus potuisset,

5 comparasset et se Bosphoranis, finitumis suIS, bellum inferre
simularet, sisque in Hispaniam legatos ac litteras misit ad eos

set: subjunctive by attraction (see

Asiae luce: 'in the foreground of
Asia,’ i.e.. in the part of Asia open
to the peoples around the Mediter-

antithesis to latebris, l. 10.

12-16. Etenim: ‘and with good

17—19. quod: ‘because’ ‘that.’ ege-
runt: ‘did something.’' reliquerunt:
‘left something undone;' both words are

4. 1-4. reliquum:
overthrow. ad . . . beni: ‘in causing

references on increpuerit, Ι. 7. 32).

this practically equivalent to maxi-
mas. l. 3.

5. Bosphoranis:
the Cimmerian Bosphorus, whom, to-
gether with many barbarous tribes and
Greek colonies on the Black Sea, Mith-
ridates had partly subdued before the
First Mithridatio War and had formed

the first war they wavered in their

the peoples near

allegiance. After the second war Mith-
ridates accomplished their final subju-
gation and placed over them as king
one of his sons, Machares·

6. simularet: the last of the four
verbs introduced by cum, l. 3: note and
bring out the change of tense. usque:
‘all the way’ from one end of the world
to the other. legatos ac litteras==
levatos cum litteriS. The levati referred
to were L. Magius and L. Fannius,

persuaded Mithridates to form an alli-
ance with Sertorius and his generals
(eos duces) in Spain.
