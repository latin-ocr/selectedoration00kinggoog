EPISTOLAE SELEGI'AE

me clamante nihil esse bello civili miserius. Itaque, cum Caesar
amentia quadam raperetur et oblitus nominis atque honorum
suorum Ariminum, Pisaurum, Anconam, Arretium occupavisset,
urbem reliquimus, quam sapienter aut quam fortiter, nihil
attinet disputari. Quo quidem in cassi simus, vides. Feruntur3
omnino condiciones ab inc, ut Pompeius eat in Hispaniam,
dilectsm, qui sunt habiti, et praesidia nostra dimittantur ; se
ulteriorem Galliam Domitio, citeriorem Considio Noniano (his
enim optigerunt) traditarum ; ad consulatus petitionem se ventu-
rum, neque se iam velle absente se rationem haberi suam; se
praesentem trinum nundinum petiturum. Accepimus condi· ᾗ

pavit, ut sine metu de his ipsis condicionibus Romae senatus

rimus). For nihil ci. Ι. 1. 3. teruntur

mands are expressed in the lndirect
quotation by ut· clauses, his promises by
