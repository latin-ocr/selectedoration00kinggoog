26. 27. intervallo: This may be taken
with hodierno die. ‘today‚ after a long

interval' (see note on primum. l. 24): or
with the abl. absolute me auctore. ‘with
me as supportet, a long way behind '—a
bit ot mock-modesty of which Cicero
was qu1t0⁸oepable (ef. Ar. ι. 1-5). me
auctore . . . exarsimus: it isarare
tmng ior the subject of the main verb to
occur also in the abl. absolute in the same
sentence (A. 419, note: B. 227. 4; H. 489,
3: H.-B. 421, 8. b). Here we may ex·
plain it by supposing the speaker inserted
the words me . . . principe atter having
begun his sentence with no such inten-

tion.
