334 ROMAN GORRFSPONDENCE

For longer communications another material (papyrus) was used, resem- 5
bling our paper, but rough and coarse. It was made from the reed of the
same name, obtained in Egypt. Upon this papyrus, or charta, they wrote
with a pen made of a split reed (calamus) and ink (atramentum)'made of
soot mixed with resinous gums. ΤΙιε ink could be washed off with a damp

⁴ sponge, which the writer kept by him for the correction of errors. The
tendency of the poor ink to blot and spread upon the poorer paper accounts
for the continued use of the bulky tabellae.

These rude writing materials, and the extensive correspondence carried 6
on by every Roman of birth and position, made it impossible for him to write
any but the most important of his letters, or those to his dearest friends,
with his own hand. The place of the stenographer and typewriter of to-
day was taken by slaves or freedmen, often highly educated, who wrote at
the dictation of the master. Such slaves were called in general terms
librarii, more particularly servi ab epistolis, servi a manu, or amanuenses.

ΙΙΙ. Trm Lama (litterae, epistola). of the six parts of a modern 7
letter—date, address, salutation‚ body, complimentary conclusion and
signature—-the address and complimentary conclusion are entirely wanting
in Latin letters, and the date is but rarely given. The delivery of the
letters by special messengers (§1) made the date and address less neces-
sary than now, and the straightforwardness of the Latin language knew
no such meaningless phrases as our ‘you·..· obedient servant,' ‘yours truly‚'
‘yours sincerely,' etc. χ

The nam when expressed will be found at the end of the letter, some- 8 ᾗ
times alone (e.g., in Ep. 9), sometimes preceded by data (7, 8, 10) agreeing ’
with epistola understood, It is written according to the whim of the
writer in the longer form a. d. vi Kal. Dec. ¹- ante diem sextum Kalendas
Decembris (10. 11) or the shorter νί Kal. Dec. - sexto [die ante] Kalendas
Decembris (⁷, 8. 9. 14). The year is occasionally given (1). When theo
place is mentioned it usually follows the date in the form required to answer
the question ‘whereY' from the standpoint of the writer (11), or the ques-
tion ‘whenceY’ from the standpoint of the receiver (8, 9, 10, 14); sometimes,
of course, the case is ambiguous (7). Finally' both date and place may be
less formally expressed in the body of the letter.

The SALUTATION and s1GNATURE are combined as in our ‘society xorm' : 10
Mr. John Doe (presents his compliments) to Mr. Richard Roe. The writer
placed his cognomen first in the nominative case, then that of the person
addressed in the dative, and finally the letters s. n. (salutem dicio: ommno
Pan-ro s. n. This formula was capable of alteration to correspond with
the tone of the letter, the fulness of both names and greeting varying
inversely with the intimacy of the correspondents. Politeness required 11
that in formal letters the praenomen of the person addressed or of both
