124 ORATIO IN CATILINAM SECUNDA

Catilinarum futurum. Verum tamen quid sibi isti miseri
Volunt? num suas secum mulierculas sunt in castra ducturi?
30 Quem ad. modum autem illis carere poterunt, his praesertim
iam noctibus? Quo autem pacto illi Appenninum atque illas
pruinas ac nives perferent? nisi idcirco se facilius hiemem
toleraturos putant, quod nudi in conviviis saltare didicerunt.
11. Ο bellum magno opere pertimescendum, cum hanc sit 24
habiturus Catilina scortorum cohortem praetoriam! Instruite
nunc, QuiriteS‚ contra has tam praeclaras Catilinae copias vestra
praesidia vestrosque exercitus. Et primum gladiatori illi con-
5 fecto et saucio consules imperatoresque vestros opponite ; deinde
contra illam naufragorum eiectam ac debilitatam manum florem
totius Italiae ac robur educite. Iam vero urbes coloniarum
ac mimicipiorum respondebunt Catilinae tumulis silvestribuS.
