ORATIO IN CATILINAM SECUNDA

oppressus aere aliens) fuit, quem nun ad hoc incredibile sceleris
foedus asciverit.

5. Atque ut eius diversa studia in dissimili ratiune perspicere 9
possitis, namu est in luds) gladiatbriu paulf) ad facinus audacior,
qui sa nun intimum Catilinae esse fateatur, namu in scaena
levior et nequior, qui se n6n eiusdem prope sodalem fuisse

5 commemoret. Atque idem tamen stuprurum et scelerum
exercitatione adsuefactus frigore et fame et siti et vigiliis
perferundis fortis ab istis praedicabatur, cum industriae
subsidia atque instrumenta virtutis in lubidine audaciaque
cunsumeret. Hunc veru si secuti erunt sui comitae, si ex urbe 10

10 exierint desperatarum hominum fiagitiusi gregeS, ὃ nus beatus,

ὃ rem publicam fortunatam, 6 praeclaram laudem cunsulatus
mei! Non enim iam sunt mediocras hominum lubidineS, non
humanae ac tolerandae audaciae; nihil cagitant nisi caedem, nisi
incendia, nisi rapinas, Patrimunia sua profudarunt, fortunas

5. 1, 2. ut . . . possitis: the sen· ing.’ never of ‘reminding’ or ‘remem-

tence is elliptical, and the verb upon
which this clause depends must be sup-
plied, ‘1 tell you thisz' such final
clauses are said to denote ‘the purpose.
not of the action, but of the mention of
the action.’ Cf. the similar ellipses with
si. 2. 4, and quod Ι, 8. 34. dissimili
ratione: ‘in different directions, lines.'
ludo gladiatorio: there were regular
training schools for gladiators, some of
the most famous at Capua. Gladiators
and actors were usually slaveS. and held
in about as high estimation as prize-
fighters and variety dancers now. auda-
cior: ‘more reckless’ than his fellows;
standard of comparlson omitted (A.
291. a; B. 240, 1: H. 498: H.-B. 241, 2).
So levior and nequior.

4, 5. sodalem: ‘brother,' a stronger
word than intimum, as it signified a
fellow member of an (originally reli-
gious) order or fraternity. It gradually
lost this meaning, and sank (as here) to
‘pal,' ‘cronyl commemoret: ‘as-
sert‚' always in Cicero a word ot ‘say-

bering.'

6, 7. exercitatione adsuetamn.
etc.: ‘trained by his practice of de-
bauchery and crime to bear cold,’ etc.;
exercitatione ls ablative of means, mod-
ifying the whole phrase adsuefactus . . .
per-ferundis: tor trinorc . . . perfer-undis
see B. 222, A: H. 476, 3: H.-B. 431.
We may perhaps regard the phrase as
a mere ablative ot respect, and tr..
‘trained in! istis: note the contempt
implied (cf. 1. 1. 15). oum: con-
cessive.

10. ο nos, etc.: for this form of
the apodosis, see on 1. 9. 14. Give
example from §7- ¹

13. audaciae: ‘acts of recklessness;'
the word in good writers has almost
always a bad sense. The plural of
abstract nouns may be rendered ‘acts
of‚' ‘instances of.’ or the Eng. singular
may be used. num nisi: ‘nothing
butz’ nisi, as a mere connective. takes
the same construction after as before it:
but ct. 1. ’1. 23.
