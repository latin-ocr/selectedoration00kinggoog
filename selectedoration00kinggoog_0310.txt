M. TULLI CICERONIS ·
PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO

When Julius Caesar in 51 desired an extension of his proconsular powers
in Gaul and the privilege of being candidate for the consulship in his
absence from Rome, one of his strongest opponente was M. Claudius Mar-
cellus, consul for that year (probably the fortissimus νίν mentioned in Ι.
8. 27). On the outbreak of civil war after Caesar's passing of the Rubicon
Marcellus joined Pompey and fought at Pharsalus. He then, on Caesar’s
gaining complete ascendency, went into retirement—a kind of voluntat-y
exile—at Mitylene, where he devoted himself to literary studies. Repeated
efforts were made, but vainly, to obtain the dictator's permission for 'his
return to Rome. At length, in the year 46, a formal appeal made to
Caesar in the senate by the exile's cousin, C. Marcellus, reinforced by a
concerted demonstration of the whole senate, was successful.

Meantime Cicero, disheartened by the commotions which threatened the
very existence of the ,republic, had lived in retirement, resolving never
to speak in public again (statueram me in perpetuum tacere), and had
devoted himself to writing on political, rhetorical and philosophical subjecte.
He was present in the senate, however, on the day of Marcellus’ pardon,
and was so affected by the great man's clemency that when called on by
the presiding consul for his sententia he made the speech here given.
