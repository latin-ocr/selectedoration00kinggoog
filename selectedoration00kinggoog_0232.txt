8. From here to the end of the
chapter Cicero makes a digression on
the selection oi' Gabinius as legatus to
Pompey. The nomination ot military
levati was the privilege ot the senate.
though the wishes ot commandere and
governors were usually consulted. For
the pirate war Pompey had been allowed
to choose his leuati himself, fifteen in
number. Gabinius was not among them,
being legally ineligible while holding the
tribuneship. At the end or his term of
office, but before Pompey had been ap-
pointed to command in the Mithridatio
War. the latter asked tor the appoint-
ment ot Gabinius as modus. to which
the senate objected, ior Gabinius would

under an imperium bestowed by a
measure which he had himself proposed.

 

indignius: may be adj.-—-·it seems the
more outrageous that objection has been
madez’ or adv.—‘objection seems to

clause ne levaretur. which therefore is the
subject or videtur or oi obtrectatum esse.

in good prose only in the second member.

in bringing forward his bill Gabinius
came near meeting with the roughest
