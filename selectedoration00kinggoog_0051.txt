LIFE OF CICERO 41

written so affectionately when an exile (Ep. 9), after thirty
years of >wedded life was divorced. He married a young
woman named Publilia, but soon separated from her. But
the crowning sorrow was the death of his daughter, Tullia,
which almost crushed him. It was only by devoting him-
self with tremendous energy and concentration to' literary
labors that he was vable to forget his public and private cares
In these last years of his life he turned out an enormous amount
of work, mostly on philosophical subjectS.

The year 44 was full of stirring events, In a letter to his 80

leaders against each other they might yet succeed (Ep. 205.
Toward the end of the year Antony's aggressions became> so

defeating him, uttered that remarkable series of invectives
known as the fourteen Philippica The fourth of these is
given in this book (see introductory note, p, 322), and Ep. ’21
deals with the events of the day on which that oration was
delivered.

In the end the sole effect of the orator's efforts was to arouse 82
the implacable hatred of Antony. Within a few months
he and Octavian reached an understanding, and with Lepidus
