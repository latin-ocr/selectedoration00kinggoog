to direct financial matters during this period (ἓ 58) ; and to it
the next board would naturally look for advice in all questions
of taxation and expenditure. In religious matters its influence 99
was due to the fact that the priests (ἓ 80), as such, had no mag-
’ isterial powerS, and had to act through the regular magistrates.
The influence of the senate over them has been explained in
ἓ 95. In all these matters, and in the countless others on which 100
. the senate acted, it must be remembered that it ruled wholly

The auspices were always taken before the meeting began (ἓ 84).

The president laid (referre) the matters about which he ¹⁰4
desired ‘advice' (ἓ 102), before the senate in general terms, and
in such order as he pleased. No one could make a motion
