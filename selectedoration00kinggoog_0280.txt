IN C. VERREM ACTIO PRIMA

de pecuniis repetundis quaereret, nuntiatur mihi tantam isti
gratulationem esse factam, ut is domum quoque pueros mit-

teret, qui uxori suae nuntiarent.

Sane ne haec quidem mihi res placebat: neque tamen, 22
tanto opere quid in hac sorte metuendum mihi esset, intel-
legebam. Unum illud ex hominibus certiS, ex⁴ quibus omnia
comperi, reperiebam: fiscos compluris cum pecunia Sicili- χ
ensi, a quodam senatore ad equitem Romanum esse trans-

' latos: ex his quasi decem fiscos ad senatorem illum relictos

esse, comitiorum meorum nomine: divisores omnium tribuum
noctu ad istum vocatos, Ex quibus quidam, qui se omnia 23
moa causa debere arbitrabatur, eadem illa nocte ad me venit:
demonstrat, qua iste oratione fisus esset: commemorasse
istum, quam liberaliter eos tractasset antea, cum ipse prae-
turam petisset) et proximis consularibus praetoriisque
comitiis: deinde continuo esse pollicitum, quantam vellent

return of money’ which had been ex-
torted. quaereret: ‘investigate’ here
as the presiding judge. Such cases as
that oi Verres would come before this
court, and ii he could secure postpone-
ment till Metellus' term began he would
enjoy the advantage of being tried be·
iore a friendly judge. isti: Verres: so
is in next clause. pueros: slaves.

14. 15. ne . . . quidem: see on
M. L. ’1. 1. sorte: the drawing by
which the assignment oi praetore was
decided (cf. sortirentur, 1. 10).

16—21. certis: ‘reliable’ nacon lit.
‘baskets,' small portable receptacles for
money. The word came under the em-
pire to mean the emperor's privy purse
as distinguished from the public treasury
(aerarium), and our word ‘fiscal' (⁸1lscal
year’) is a derivative. senatore . . .
equitem . . . divisores: It seems that
dhe ‘system’ was as fully organized as
in some oi our modern cities. The sen-

ator transmitted the money to be used
in bribing jurors and voters to one oi
the equites. to which order the large
business-men. as a rule, belonged (ct.
M. L. 2. 5), and be distributed it to
‘ward beelers’ (divisores), who were to
approach the individuals it was desired
to corrupt. In this case the divisores
received their money and their instrue-
tions from Verres himself (istum) at his
own house. quasi doum: ‘perhaps
ten.’ like the Greek ὥς. noctua for
the sake oi secrecy (ci. 1. 8. 1-3).
comitiorum . . . nomine: ‘on account
oi my election.’ Cicero was candidate
for the aedileship, and the ten ‘baskets’
retained by the senator were to be used

in a special attempt to defeat him. The,

fact that the money was from Sicily
(l. 17) indicated clearly that Verres was
behind the move.

22. mea eausa: ‘ior my sake!
debere: ‘owed,' ‘ought to do!

23. demonstrat: governs the in-
direct discourse to dicerem, l. 33.
