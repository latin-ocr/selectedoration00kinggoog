ML TULLT CICERONIS
ORATIO IN OATILTN AM SECUNDA

AD POPULUM

1. Tandem aliquando, QuiriteS‚ L. Catilinam furentem
audacia, scelus anhelantem, pestem patriae nefarie molientem,
vobis atque huic urbi ferro fiammaque minitantem ex urbe
vel eiecimus vel emisimus vel ipsum egredientem verbis

5 prosecuti sumus.

ΤιτιΕ. Read the notes on 1, Tine.
Aa populum: A speech delivered ad
populum, ‘before the people.’ was called
a contio: and a gathering of the people
to hear the speech was called by the
same name. For the circumstances
under which this contio was delivered
see Introduction. ,

Catiline is pone: we have him where we
want him. 551, 2.

1. 1. Tandem anquando: see on 1.
10. l: which word might be omitted?
Quirites: the formal title of the Ro-
man people when assembled in their civil
capacity and addressed by a Roman.
Th«- derivation and meaning of the word
are uncertain. What is the formal title
ot the senators as a body? ·

3. vobin and urbi are indirect ob-
JectS. term and flamma are ablatives
ot instrument: instead oi the ablatives
accusatives might have been used: we
can say minitari alicui aliqua re or mi-
num-i alicui aliquid.

4. vel . . . vel . . . vel: imply lib-
erty or choice, ‘either . . . or . . .

Abiit, excessit, evasit, erupit.

N silla iam

as you plesse! In this passage each
vel substitutes a milder form of expres-
sion for the preceding. because Cicero
does not yet feel quite sure of the atti-
tude of the people. He speaks more
boldly in the third oration. The sen-
tence may be translated: ‘We have
driven him out—let him go, it you will
—at least bidden him good speed on
his voluntary departure.’ In the next
sentence each word is stronger than the
preceding, thus reversing the order here.
ipsum=⁸ua sponte, ultro, as some-
times in colloquial English. verbis
prosecuti sumus: ironica13 quote a
similar ironical expression fr91n Ι. 8.
35-38. What are the verba he speaks
of?

5. Abiit. excutit. evasit, erupit:
the four words are to be taken in two
pairs„ i.e., with a slight pause after
excessit: see on I. δ. 7, and quote a
parallel from Ι. 18. 22. Nuus lam:
‘no longer‚' a little more emphatic than
non iam, l. 8: cf. 1. 7. 3. Note that all

or, Ἰ the verbs so far have been perfect, tell-
