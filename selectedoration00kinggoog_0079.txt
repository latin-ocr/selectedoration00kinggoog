THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 69

debate Was allowed he called upon the members to express their
views in a regular order, sanctioned by ancient custom, giving
his own opinion at any point he pleased. The first to be called 105
upon was the Princeps Senatus, an hon( rary title given by the
censors to the senator (generally a patrician) whom they deemed
most worthy. After him came the consulares, praetorii and ,
aedilicii, i.e., such members as sat in the senate by virtue of
having held these officeS. If, however, the debate occurred 1⁰⁶
between the time of the annual elections and the inauguration
of the successful candidateS, these magistrates-elect (desiqnati)
took precedence over ex—magistrates of the same rank. It is a
matter of dispute whether or not the pedarii (those who had
held no curule [ἓ 45, 1V, b] office) had the ius sententiae, ‘right
of debate.' The president might, however, vary the regular 107
order, and thus honor or slight any senator by calling him out
of turn, or by passing him over altogether. As each senator
was called upon he could give his opinion in full (sententiam
dicere), or simply express his agreement with a previous speaker
(verbo assentiri). He might also include in his remarks any
other matters that he pleased, and this made it easier than
now to prevent action by talking against time (diem dicendo
consumere) until sunset (ἓ 103). The final vote was taken by 1⁰8
division (discessio). If several conflicting sententiae had been
expressed the magistrate presiding put such as he pleased to
the house, and they were voted upon singly until one received
a majority of the members present. All present, except actual
magistrateS, were obliged to vote, but there was no rule as to
a quorum. When a sententia had been adopted it was written 100
out, after the adjournment of the senate, by the scribae (ἓ 70),
in the presence of the president and of its principal supporters, Α
who attested its genuineness by their signatures. There are
frequent complaints of forged sententiae.
