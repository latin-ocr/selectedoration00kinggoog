Plutarch in his life of Cicero (eh. 16) says: ‘Cicero summoned the
senate to the temple of Jupiter Stator, at the end of the Via Sacra. When
Catiline came, as if to make a defense, none would sit near him, and
when he began to speak he was shouted down. . . . At length Cicero
arose and ordered him to leave the city, saying that as he himself was
ruling by speech and the other by force of arms there ought to be a wall

between them. Catiline speedily left the city with three hundred men,

and having surrounded himself as if consul with the fasces and military
standards he set out to Manlius!

Of the first oration Sallust (Cat. 31. 13 ff.) says: ‘Tum M. Tullius
consul . . . . orationem habuit luculentam atque utilem rei publicae.
