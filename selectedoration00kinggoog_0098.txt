'84 ORATIO IN CATILINAM PRIMA

5. Quae cum ita sint, Catilina, perge, quo coepisti, egredere
aliquando ex urbe ; patent portae ; proficiscere. Nimium din
te imperatorem tua illa Manliana castra desiderant. Educ
tecum etiam omnes ωδε, si minus, quam plurimos ; purga

5, urbem. Magno me metii liberabiS, dum modo inter me atque
te murus intersit. Nobiscum versari iam diutius non potes ;
non feram, non patiar, non sinam. Magna dis inmortalibus ll
habenda est atque huic ipsi Iovi Statori, antiquissimo custodi
huius urbiS, gratia, quod hanc tam taetram, tam horribilem

ιο tamque infestam reio publicae pestem totiens iam effugimus.
Non est saepius in uno ho‘mine summa salus periclitanda rei
publicae. Quamdiu mihi consuli designato, Catilina, insidiatus

Leave Rome, Catiline, as you have atque . . . Iovi:
‘to (all).the gods, but especially to, etc.’

planum, §mo—12.

5. 1. quae . . . sint: ’since this is
so) In Latin a relative often occurs at
the beginning of a sentence when the
English would have a personal or a
demonstrative: this is especially notice-
able when (as here) the verb is intro-
duced by a subordinating conjunction.
qu0:=(ad eum locum) ad quem; se. ire.
How does this qvo differ from the one
in 4. 16?

3. imperatorem: While Manlius
(see on 2. 17 and 3. 9) was in charge of
the insurgents’ camp at present the real
commander (2. 19), under whose aus-
picia the campaign was to be con-
ducted, was Catiline, and he here is ex-
horted to go and take up his duties as
such. Manlianaz==Manli. Explain
the aglj. Educ: What verbs lose the
final -e in this form? (A. 182; Β. 116,
3; Η. 241; Η.-Β. 164, 1).

4. sl minus: i.e.. si minus (=non)
omnes educere potens, quam plurimos educ.
6. mutus: see on parietibus, 3. 3.

7. non reram, patiar, sinam: This
is not an example of climax, but a device,
very common in Latin, for emphasizing
an idea by an accumulation ot synon-
ymous words. 'frana ⁰1 may not, can-
not, will not endure it.’ or ‘I’ll not bear
it, submit to it, permit it.' «ns . . .

(not dat. of agent),

8. huic: Why is the demonstrative
of the first person used? See on 1. 4.
Statori: ⁴(flight) stayer.’ Tradition
said that a temple was dedicated to
Jupiter under this name by Romulus
for having stopped the ssight of the
Romans during the decisive battle in
the war with the SabineS. Hence anti-
quissimo custodi. Decline Iovi Statori
(A. 79 and b: Β. 41; H. 107. 32 H.-B.
92).

9. hane tam taetram: The tam is
not to be translated. When a demon-
strative and a positive adjective of
quality modify a noun the Latin idiom
inserts a tam: so hic tantus (=tam may-
nus) vir, haec ἰοί (=tam multa) peri-
cula, etc.

11. uno homine: ‘in the person of
one man '—oi'ten taken as referring to
Catiline, but better to Cicero. as shown
in ll. 18, 19 below. summa salus rei
publicae: ‘the best interests of the
nation,' a very common phrase for
which summa res publica is often used
with no difference in meaning.

12. consuli designato: A man was
consul desiqnatus, ‘consul elect,' trem
his election in’July to his inauguration‚
Jan. 1st: consul during his year of office.
and consularis, ‘ex-consul,’ during the
