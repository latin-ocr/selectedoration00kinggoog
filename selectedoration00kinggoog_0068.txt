at public festivities a toga wholly of purple; they also sat upon
an official chair made of ivory and called the sella curulis
(representing the ancient throne of the kingS, whose authority
had been divided among these magistrates), and hence were
called curule magistrates (mayistratus carulas). The tribuneS,
quaestors and plebeian aediles had no insiqnia. Magistrates 552
could not be dismissed during their year of office, and were not
amenable to the courts while in office, though they were liable
to prosecution for bribery at their election before their term
began, and for misbehavior in office as soon as their terms
expired. Hence no magistrate could be elected to successive
terms of the same office.

(l) The Consules—,The consulship was the goal of every 53
Roman's ambition, the highest magistracy. The consuls were
two in number, and were elected several· months before their
term began, usually in J uly, but the precise date was fixed by
the senate or by the consuls. They were the ordinary presiding
officers of the senate, directed its deliberationS, and executed its
orderS. They took precedence over all other magistrates in
summoning the senate and comitia centuriata, and presided 54
over the latter body at the election of all curule magistrates
They usually took turns in acting as head of the administration,
each taking precedence for a month, beginning with the elder.
During his month each consul was always attended in public
by twelve Βίστονας, who marched before him in single file, each
carrying upon his shoulder the fasce-3, a bundle of rods typifying
the consul's right to scourge. Originally an axe had been 55
bound up with the rods, but this was not carried in the city
after the granting of the ius provocationis (g 3). The consuls
gave their names to their year of office, and as ex-consuls
(consulares) retained much of their dignity, took precedence
of other senators in debate, and were alone eligible to certain
positions of honor.

(2) The Censores—The censors were two in number, elected 50
from the consulares (ἓ 55), originally at the minimum interval
