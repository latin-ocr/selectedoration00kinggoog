66 · INTRODUCTION

was because it was thought that the will of the gods was not yet
fully ascertained. If therefore a magistrate gave notice that on89
a certain day, or series of dayS‚ he intended to ‘watch the
heavens' (servare de caelo), none of the acts requiring auspices
(ἓ 84) could be performed on that day or that series of days.
This notice was called obnuntiatiO, and was frequently employed
against an obstinate tribune by magistrates who had other-
wise no power over him (ἓ 72), as well as by the other magis-90
trates against each other. From this it will be seen that a

became a member of the college ten years after his consulship.
The insignia of the office were the toqa praetexta, the purple

Other Boards. —Below the augurs were numerous other 91
boards and guildS. The Quindecemviri Sacris Faciundis had

Cumaean Sibyl had sold to Tarquinius Superbus They con-

interpreted by the board only by direct command of the senate.
The Haruspices were an unofficial guild, though they were some— 92
times consulted by the senate when unusual omens or portents
were announced. They foretold the future by lightning and
the entrails of victims slain in sacrifice, and thus claimed to do
much more than the augurS, who could at best only get responses
to such questions as could be answered ‘Yes' or ‘No.' On the
other hand the augurs ridiculed the pretensions of the haruspice-3,
and asserted that they merely worked upon the superstitious
fears of the ignorant.

The senate was originally the body of old men (sena-tus, cf. 93 ζ
senex) called upon by the King to advise him when in doubt. It
had never acquired any additional rights by law, in fact it had
no constitutional powers at all, but it had come to dominate
