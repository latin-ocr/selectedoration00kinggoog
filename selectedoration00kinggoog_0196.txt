l'.'8 DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI

circumstances Mithridates and Tigranes resumed operatione and won
several battles more or less important over Roman lieutenants,
Mithridates thereby regaining almost the whole of the territory taken
from him. M’. Acilius Glabrio, one of the consuls of 67, was appointed to
succeed Lucullus. The disobedience of the soldiers increased. Glabrio
upon arriving in Asia in 66 did not assume command of the army of
Lucullus, but went to his province, Bithynia, and there idly remained
with the excuse that he must better prepare for such a contest. Mean-
while, in 67, the tribune Aulus Gabinius brought forward a bill giving
Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus extraordinary powers for a war against the
pirates of the Mediterranean, who for many years had preyed upon Roman
commerce, hindered the importation of corn, and diminished the revenues
of the state. In a campaign of three months Pompey annihilated the
pirates and gained control of Cilicia, their stronghold, which was after-
ward made a Roman province. He was still in the south of Asia Minor
in 66, when Gaius Manilius, tribune of the people, proposed that Pompey
be intrusted with the war against Mithridates, as described. .
