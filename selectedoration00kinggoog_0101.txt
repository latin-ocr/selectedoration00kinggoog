10 superioris uxons novis nuptiis domum vacuefecisseS, nonne
etiam alio incredibili scelere hoc scelus cumulasti?

quod ego

praetermitto et facile patior sileri, ne in hac civitate tanti faci-
noris inmanitas aut extitisse aut non vindicata esse videatur.
Praetermitto ruinas fortunarum tuarum, quas omnis inpendere

15 tibi proxumis Idibus senties; ad illa venio, quae non ad privatam

ignominiam vitiorum tuorum, non ad domesticam tuam
difficultatem ac turpitudinem, sed ad summam rem publicam
atque ad omnium nostrum vitam salutemque pertinent.

Potestne tibi haec 11111, Catilina, aut huius caeli spiritus esse 15
20 iucunduS, cum scias esse horum neminem, qui nesciat te pridie

Kalendas Ianuarias Lepido et Tullo consulibus stetisse in

visited at night; yet a figurative sense
is easily seen—‘a firebrand to kindle his
evil passione! Quid vero: see on
quid. 8. 19. morte superioris uxoris:
The second wife was Aurelia Orestilla, a
woman 01 great beauty‚ but infamous
life. morte: intentionally ambiguous;
it might be ablative of time, but Cicero
intends it to be taken as means (-nece,
caede). ·

11. incredibili scelere: the murder
ot his son. Orestilla objected to marry-
ing a man with chssdren.

12. praetermitto, etc.: a common
rhetorical trick (praeteritio, occultatio),
by which the speaker, aflecting lor-
bearance‚ careiully says what he pre-
tends to leave unsaid. Give example
from ch. 1. sileri: ‘be passed over in
silence!

13. ’ non: may be rendered by English
prefix ura-3 non vindicata - ⁶ unpunished.'

15. Idibus: what day 01 the mouth?
Now that Catiline's hopes were blighted
his creditors would 'not be likely to
show further forbearance, and the Ides
and Kalends were the regular days for
the settlement ot accounts. The orator
intimates that Catiline's financial ruin
will be accomplished within six days
(Roman count) 110111 the time he is

speaking.

17. 18. maculatam: ‘embarrass-
ment.’ i.e.. in money matters: see pre-
ceding note. summam rem publi·
cam: what is the fuller expression?
See 011 8. 11. nostrum: gen. pl. ot
eqo, denoting possession. What is the ’
regular construction? See on 8. 18.
This use of the genitive is allowable only
when the pronoun ls accompanied by
omnium, and even then the regular con-
struction is as common (see on 4. 11).

You are accomplishinq nothinq here,

Kalendas: see A. 432. a; B. 144, 2:
H. 420, 5; Η.-Β. 380, 0. Lepido, etc.:
B. 0. ‹lo—see Chron. Table. Cicero puts
the time one day earlier than other
authorities. It was the very next year
(65) that Cicero in ·a letter to his friend
Atticus (Ep. 1) mentions his purpose to
defend Catiline against the prosecution
for misgovernment as propraetor 111
Africa in the hope of winning Catiline’s
support 111 111301νο (Cicero’s) candidacy
for the consulship—the electlon of 64.
