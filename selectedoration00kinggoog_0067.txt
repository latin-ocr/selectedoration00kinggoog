THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 57

The duties of these magistrates, none of whom received
salary, are given below in the order of 1⁴ (a) and (b)·.

(a) 'l'ho Extraordinsry magistratum—In times of danger 46
without or of anarchy within the state, the senate might call
upon one of the consuls to appoint, for six months only, an
officer called Dictator, who had supreme and absolute authority
in all matters concerning the state. The dictator appointed
an assistant or vice-dictator, who ranked next to himself in
