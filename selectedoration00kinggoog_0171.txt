556. aequo ao: see on 8. 26. priore a hint at the action yet to be taken iu
nocto: ‘last night,’ the night of the regard to the prisoners, who were still
arrest. custodiis vigmuque: for dis· in custody.

Plutarch (Cic. 19), after telling of the arrest and examination of the
conspirators, and the senate’s decree‚ adds: ‘As it was now evening
and the people were lingering about in crowdS, Cicero came forth and
told them of the senate' s action!

The third oration is not mentioned by Sallust except by casual refer- ’
enee in an ablative absolute m ch.48.1: ‘,Plebs coniuratione patefacta,

. . Ciceronem ad caelum tollere!

· Omission of the word-lists at the close of the notes on each chapter
does not imply that such review is no longer needed. The exercises
may be varied, however, as the teacher may see fit. For example the
great number of ablatives in chapter 1 may be examined and classified
by the student; so may the expressions of time in chapter 2, the sub-
ject of letterwriting in chapter 5, and so on, according to the needs or
interest of the class,

The grammatical points brought out in the notes on this oration may
well be added to the student' s index on orations I and ΙΙ, though by this
time he should have learned sufficiently the use and the value of tho
general index.
