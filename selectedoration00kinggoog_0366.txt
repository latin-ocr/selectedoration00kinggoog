A dictated letter,- Pompev's perplexam,-

hints ot cominq trouble tor the writer.

IN'rnonuc'roRY No'rn: Written from
Rome to Atticus in Epirus in August, 59.
The letter shows how little the writer
comprehended the political maneuvers
ot Caesar, and how blindly he still
trusted to Pompey.

epistolam, understood with scriptam (cf.

‘business,' explained in 1. 12 ff. vocu-
lae: ‘what is left. ot my voice’ will
fairly represent the diminutive. mihi:
tor case see A. 383: 455, 1: B. 192:
Η. 434, 23 H.-B. 362. What other case

might we expect? ambulare: wanting
in the open air was believed to be good
tor the voice. What-other mood could
we have had? See A. 569, 2, both
notes; Β. 295, 6, 8; 327, 1: H. 564, ΙΙ, 1;

in his dispatches3 ior case and that oi
status see references on tactorum, 1v.
10. 7. poenitere, cupere: Pompey

was dissatisfied with the inferior part in g

politics which he had to take under

Caesar, but he did not have enough

decision of character to do more than

coquet with the senate. Notice that f
Sampsiceramum is object of poenitere and ζ
subject ot cupere: for a similar double ᾗ
construction ci. quibus. 11. 11. ll· 2
