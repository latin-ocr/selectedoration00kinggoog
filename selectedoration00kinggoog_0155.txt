senatum Allobrogum populumque litterae. Si quid de his
20 rebus dicere vellet, feci potestatem. Atque ille primo quidem
negavit; post autern aliquanto, toto iarn indicio exposito atque
edito, surrexit ; quaesivit a Gallis, quid sibi esset cum iis, quam

leryz’ the word is chosen to imply that
it was the quality or the weapons, not

despite its position, with litterae. ad

the use tor which they were designed,
that secured them a place in his ‘col-
lection.’

11, 12. manum: ‘handwritingz’ so
also in colloquial English. tabente:
‘his letter;' so in l. 13 (see on 2. 15).
in eandem sententiam: ‘to the same
purport.’ an adjective phrase to be
joined directly with tabellae. Such at-

tributive phrases are usually connected·

with their nouus by a participle (here
we should expect scriptae) or a relative
clause.

15. imago: Le.. the head only; the
son ot the elder Scipio had also such a
signet ring, on which his tather's head
was cut. avi tui: Lentulus’ grand-
father, P. Cornelius Lentulus, was con-
sul in 162.

all else: ‘with his whole beart! quae

ϋαηι, 1. 12), abl. ot quality, to be joined,

l. 12: here we should expect datae.

evidence having been arranged and put
in form! The stories ot the Gauls and
Volturcius. and the letters of the three
conspirators. agreed in general, with
some repetitions and minor differences.
After all had been written down by the
clerks the several parts were carefully
compared, the facts were arranged in
their proper order, and the whole was
then copied out in a connected and
coherent form. Exposita refers to the
sitting and arranging3 edito to the draw-
ing up in torm. It was the complete-
ness and straightforwardness of the com-
bined‘ evidence, that broke Lentulus
down. surrent: (surae), ‘leaped to
his teet! quid sibi esset cum us.
etc.: ‘what business he had with them,
to bring them to his house.’
ob rem: relative, not interrogative
clause.

24. constanter:
all told the same story.

‘consistently;' i.e..
