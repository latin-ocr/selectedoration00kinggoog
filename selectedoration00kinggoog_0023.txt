LIFE OF CICERO 13

His Positiou in utentum—To the pursuit of literature 6
Cicero brought extraordinary intellectual capabilitieS, a strong
imagination, refined and elevated tastes and habits of appli-
cation that excite our amazement. His learning was great
—Varro alone of his contemporaries surpassed him—and to
the end of his life he read and studied incessantly. His memory,
