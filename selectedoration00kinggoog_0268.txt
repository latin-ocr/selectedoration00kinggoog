248 IN C. VERREM ACTIO PRIMA

was granoed an allowance of 110 days in which to gather his evidence.
So intensely did he devote himself to the matter, however, that he was
ready in fifty days (2. 31). His promptness defeated another scheme for
delay by slipping in the case of another corrupt governor ahead of the
trial of Verres, which was called forthwith.

Meantime Cicero was harassed by attempts to defeat his candidacy
for the aedileship by corrupt means, and to secure a jury which could
be bribed or intimidated. Both plans failed, and early in August the
case was ready for argument. The drawing for jurymen had been un-
usually fortunate (6. 16), and, reinforced by Cicero's careful use of his
right of challenge (reiediO, 6. 17), had given him an intelligent and incor-

· ruptible jury. But this was just what the defense did not want, and
they bent all their efforts to securing postponement, in the hope of throw-
ing the trial over into the following year, when both consuls and the
praetor who would preside over that court would be friendly to the
defendant, and many of the best jurors would be ineligible to serve
(10. 10-.34).

The usual practice was for the prosecution, aster the opening address,
ιο present its case in full (oratio perpetua). The defense would reply
after a brief adjournment, and then would come the taking of evidence.
It was late in the year, there were many holidays on which court could
not sit, and to follow the usual method would give the defense a good

‚ opportunity to gain the time they desired. Cicer0, therefore, delivered
his opening address and prepared immediately to state his points and
present his evidence.

The oration that follows is the opening speech, and is known as Actio
Prima in Verrem.
