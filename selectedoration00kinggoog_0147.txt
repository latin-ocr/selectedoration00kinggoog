1. Rem publicam, Quirites, vitamque omnium vestrum, 1
bona, fortunas. coniuges uberesque vestres atque hoc domi-
cilium clarissuml imperii, fortunatissimam pulcherrimamque
urbem, hodierne die de6rum inmortalium summ6 erga ves
5 ambre, lab6ribuS, cc'msiliis, periculis meis e flamma atque ferrc‘)
ac paene ex faucibus fati ereptam et vebis censervatam ac

restitutam 'videtis

Et si nen minus n6bis iucundi atque 2

inlustres sunt ii dies, quibus cdnservamur‚ quam illi, quibus
nascimur, quod salutis certa laetitia est, nascendi incerta con-
ιο ἀίοἰό, et quod sine sensu nascimur, cum voluptate servamur,

For the circumstances see Introduc-
tion, and Sallust. Cat. 40, 4447..

1. 1-22. Exonnmu: ·You are rejoic-
ino over the safetv or the citu. and wait-
ina to hear how that δαΐαν has been
asem-ed, 551, 2.

1. Quantos: see on 11. 1. 1.

4. hodierno ‹neahodia Le.. Dec. 3.
The senate had been in session all day,
considering the documents seized on the
Mulvian bridge in the early morning,
and examining the persons compro-
mised by them. This oration contains
Cicero's account to the citizens oi the
day’s events, <It is less a true oration
than a bit or narrative.

θ, 7. The participles ereptam, etc..

modify all the accusatives to urbem:
how is their form explained? videtis:
a general idea of the events ot the morn-
ing and preceding night had spread
through the city, but particulars were
wanting. Et si: here, as often, the con-
dition cannot be distinguished in sense
from a causal clause with quod. quia
(see on ΙΙ. 10. 10); so in English.

9. nascendi condicio: ‘the terms οι
birth;' i.e., the lot into which we are
born.

10. sensu:
tate:

‘consciousnessss volup-
‘a sense or pleasure‚' the so-
called ‘pregnant' use of a word, the
sense requiring an extension oi its strict
meaning.
