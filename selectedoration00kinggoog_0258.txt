PRO ARCHIA POETA

ao sepulcro Scipionum putatur is esse constitutus ex marmore ;
cuius laudibus certe non solum ipse, qui laudatur, sed etiam

populi Romani nomen ornatur.

In caelum huius proavus Cato

tollitur 3 magnus honos populi Romani rebus adjungitur.
Omnes denique illi Maximi, Marcelli, Fulvii non sine communi

35 omnium nostrum laude decorantur.
10. Ergo illum, qui haec fecerat, Rudinum hominem maior&
nostri in civitatem receperunt ; nos hunc Heracliensem multis

5 Nam, si quis minorem gloriae fructum putat ex Graecis ver· 23
sibus percipi quam ex Latmia vehementer errat, propterea

33. tollitur: really the protasis,
though no subordinate connective is

great honor attaches to the Roman peo-

ple.’ A case ot parataxis (A. 2683
1:1.·B. 227).
34. maximi: 'men like Maximus!

Q. Fabius Maximus Cunctator was a
hero ot the Second Punic War‚ famous
for his policy ot caution and delay in
opposing Hannibal. Marcelli: M.
Claudius Marcellus. another hero of the
same war. the captor ot Syracuse. Pul-
vss: M. Fulvius Nobilior, consul in 189:
he conquered the Aetolians soon atter,

Ennius. It was Fulvius's son who
oecured Ennius Roman citizenship.

10. 1. mum: Ennius. Rudinum:
‘though a native ot Rudiae: Rudiae

was a Calabrlan town of little impor-
tance‚ probably not a civitas foederata.
The word is in contr-ast with Ησα-

3. hae: sc. σιύἰωέο. meaning the city
of Heraclea: in the next line civitate has

been alud to honor and betrimd pods.

5-8. Kame introducing a supposed
objection and answer. Graecu versi-
bus: Ennius had written in Latin.
while Archias's poems were in Greek:
hence the necessity of this passage.
Graeca: neuter pl.—⁸Greek.’ Latina:
‘Latin.' stus umbus: at the time ot
this speech the use ot Latin had not
extended much beyond Latium and

Rome’s conquests were extensive.

‘limita’ cum . . . tum: correlative
