THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 51 Ι

people giving the right of serving on juries, which had formerly
belonged to the senatorial order exclusively, to those persons
not senators who were worth not less than 400‚000 sesterces
(320,000). This gave the state a new order ; and the nobles,
prevented by law from engaging in trade, found themselves
confronted by an aristocracy of wealth, which they in turn
excluded from political preferment. To this second order the 20
name Ordo Equester was given, not that it had anything to do
with military service, but because its census (400‚000 sesterces)
was the same that had in early times entitled a citizen to serve
in the cavalry. The insiqnia of the knights were a gold ring
and the tunica anqusticlavia (with two narrow purple stripes).

c. The Common3.—Below the N obles and the Knights 21
came the great mass of the citizens, the CommonS. They ·

Cicero's time was pitiable. The combinations of capital shut
them out of commerce and manufacture, while the competition

them. Some found employment in the colonies and provinces,
some eked out a scanty living on their farmS, some made war
their trade ; but the idle and degraded flocked into the capital
to live on the cheap grain provide'd by the treasury, and to sell
their votes to the highest bidder.

It must be remembered, however, that no citizen was abso· 23
lutely excluded from either of the ordine& The meanest citizen
could become a Knight by amassing the required sum of 400,000
sesterceS, and the poorest could make himself a senator and his
descendants noble by beating the senatorial candidate for a
quaestorship, and then gaining a curule office.

Nothing certain is known of the number of citizens at this 24
time. The census of 241 showed 260,ooo citizens of military
