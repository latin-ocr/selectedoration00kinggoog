M. TULL1 CICERONIS
IN O. VERREM ACTIO PRIMA

AD IUDICES

The whole career of C. Verres, as we know it, was evil. He began
his cursus honorum in 82 as quaestor under Cn. Papirius Carb0, of the
Marian party, but deserted him and carried the money entrusted to him
over to Sulla (4. 5-8). As proquaestor to Dolabella in Cilicia he aided
in that general's extortions and shared the proceeds3 but when Dola-
bella was brought to trial Verres turned against him (4. 9—14).

In 74 he was praetor urbanus, in which office he presided over the
drawing of jurors for the trial of the notorious Oppianicus, and arranged
beforehand (13. 24) for his conviction. As to the general character of .
his tenure of that office we read (4. 15—17), ‘his praetorship was the
plundering of holy temples and public works and the awarding of owner-
ship and possession of property without regard to law and precedent!

With this preparation he went to Sicily in 73 as propraetor, remaining
for three years. There he employed every possible means of enriching
himself at the expense of the helpless provinciale, seizing money, jewels,
plate and* art treasures wherever they were found, in private or public
buildings or even temples of the gods. In the course of these extortions
he performed countless acts of cruelty, sometimes, it would seem, in
. sheer wantonness (4. 18—5. 26).

On the expiration of his term the Sicilians brought accusation against
him de repetundis, and engaged Cicer0, who had been quaestor in the
island in 77, ιο conduct the prosecution. Opposed to him was Hor-
tensius, recognized as the greatest Roman lawyer. One of the earliest
moves of the defense was an attempt ιο have the prosecution conducted
by one Caecilius, in whose hands it would have been a mere farce. Cicero's
first argument in the case, therefore, was in Q. Caecilium, to show the
grounds of his claim ιο represent the SicilianS. It was successful, and he
