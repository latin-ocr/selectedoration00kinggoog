LIFE OF CICERO · 39

Tullia met him—the 5th of August happened to be her birth·
day—and here on the 8th he learned finally that his banish-
ment was at an end. His return to Rome was a triumphal
march. Crowds attended him 3 deputatione from all over
Italy met and welcomed him; no sign of joy or mark of honor
was omitted on the way, and in the city itself the ‘demonstra—

influence promptly felt. ⁸

In 51 Cicero was made proconsul governing Cilicia, and 75
was absent from Italy for about eighteen months, May, 51, to
November, 50, and from the city a little longer. To this
period belong some of his most interesting letterS, one of
