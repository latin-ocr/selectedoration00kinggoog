INTRODUCTION 71

HOW CICERO'S WORKS WERE PRESERVED

Of Cicero's orations we have fifty-seven complete or nearly so,
with portions of twenty others and the titles of thirty more.
Some were written carefully before delivery‚ and at least one—-
cum senatui qratias eqit, on his return from exile—was read from
manuscript. On the other hand the first oration against

Catiline, delivered impromptu, was ‘afterward written out and ·

published' (Sall. 31). In his defense of Milo the orator broke
down, and what we know as pro Milone was written afterward
to show what he had meant to say. Sometimes a mere outline
was used in speaking and the full text written out later. In
some cases omissions have been made in preparing for publica-
tion, in others new matter has been inserted (see note in italics
at end of Ι. 10).

For much of the text we are indebted to Cicero’s faithful
secretary, Tiro, who had a system of shorthand of his own ; and
for its preservation to Atticus, who as a publisher handled
many of the orations and letters (for the methods followed see
J ohnston's Privata Life of the Roman-5, ἐξ 393-402).

Of the 864 letters extant all but about ninety are Cicero's
own. They are assembled in ‘books '—two to M. BrutuS, three
to Q. Cicero, sixteen to Atticus and sixteen to various intimate
friends (ad Familiares). The selections in this volume are
taken from the books ad Familiares and ad Atticum.

The oldest manuscript copy we have of the orations against
Catiline was made nearly a thousand years after their delivery,
and except for some fragments dating perhaps to the fourth or
fifth century Aa). the same is true of all Cicero's works. The
orations were first printed (editio princeps) at Rome (or Venice?)
in 1471, and the complete works at Venice in 1534-37.
