law of Rullus, the trial of Rabirius for the death of Saturninus»,
the proposal to restore to their rights the children of those
whom Sulla had proscribed, Caesar’s intrigues to secure, the
office of pontifex maximus, Cicero's law to check bribery,
and above all the rivalry of the candidates for the consul-
ship of 62. One of these candidates was Catiline.

Gatssine’s 'l'hird Attempt.—Discouraged and disheartened 32
as Catiline was by his second failure, he could not give up
and turn· back. He had staked his all and his friends’ all
upon the consulship: he would make one more effort to secure
the prize—if that failed there was nothing left him but ruin
or civil war. He had already exhausted all means countenanced
or employed by the Romans in their party struggles. One
last resort remained, and so without openly renouncing the
support of the democrats he strove to attach to himself a
personal following, not a ‘party,' of the bankrupt and the
ruined. There was no lack of material to work upon. There 33
were the dissipated youth, those who had no possessions, the
spendthrifts and criminals of all kinds, the veterans of Sulla
who after quickly squandering their ill-gotten riches longed
for new booty‚ the great mass of those who had been driven
from house and home by the military colonieS, and finally—
the most dangerous clement—the mob of the capital, always
thirsting for pillage and blood. What hopes Catiline held
up before these new supportem, cannot be definitely deter-
mined; the designs of anarchists are not usually very precise
and well defined. He undoubtedly promised a cancellation
of debts (novae tabulae), and the spoils of office with hints at
the proscription of the rich—just as he had promised in 64,
but on a larger scale. The threats of fire, pillage, outrage
and murder that we read of must have been the idle moutnings
of his followerS, or thrown back upon this time from the events
of the following summer and fall. “
