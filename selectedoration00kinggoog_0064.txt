54 INTRODUC'I'ION

when a law was proposed, or with the names of the candidates
when an election was in progress. One tribe (tribus praem-33
yativa) was selected by lot to vote first; and the members of that
tribe passed out of the saepta one by one through a narrow
opening (pons), each depositing his ticket in a box provided
for the purpose. The vote of this tribe was immediately 34
announced to the remaining thirty-four, and (as the gods χ
were supposed to direct the lot) it was usually confirmed by a
majority of the others. The rest of the tribes then voted in the
same manner as the first, but at the same time, and the
matter was decided by a majority (eighteen) of the tribal
votes.

The comitia centuriata went through similar formalities. 35
The people were arranged, each century to itself, around the
sides of the Campus MartiuS‚ a large space being left unoccupied
in the centre. The seventy centuries of the first and wealthiest
class cast lots to see which should vote first (centuria praero-
9ativa), and the result of its vote was announced. Then the 36
remaining centuries of the first class (sixty-nine) and the
eighteen centuries of nobles (ss 30) votedat the same time. The
other classes followed in order of wealth3 but with each of these
four classes voted an extra century made up of citizens who
had arrived too late to vote with their proper centuries, thus
making a total of three hundred and seventy-seven voteS, a
majority of which decided the matter.

None of these assemblies were in any sense deliberative 37
bodies, They could assemble only when called together by the
proper magistrate, and then only to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no,' without
the right to debate or amend, upon the question which he put
before them, or to elect or reject some candidate whom he
nominated to them. They were dissolved at any moment 38
when it was his pleasure to stop their proceedingS‚ and if he
saw fit he could annul the election of a successful candidate by
simply refusing to proclaim the result officially.

Nor were the assemblies at the mercy of the presiding magis- 39
