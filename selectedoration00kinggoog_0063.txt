THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 53

Ι. ’Πιο Comitia Curiata—This ancient assembly had lost28
all political power, and was called together merely as a matter
of form to confer the imperium upon the consuls, to authorize
adoptions, etc. Its authority was so shadowy that the curiae
were merely represented by a single delegate each.

11. 'I'he Comitia 'bibam—This had once been an assembly2s
of plebeians only, but had grown in influence until in Cicero's
time it was the most important of the comitia, and all legislation
had practically passed into its hands. It could be summoned
by a consul, praetor or tribune. Its meetings were held in the

ι forum. 1†- elected tribuneS, quaestore, aedileS, and petty

magistrates. Most of the laws that have come down to us
were adopted in this assembly and were called plebiscita.

111. The Comitia centuriata—Originally devised by 30

Servius Tullius this assembly had been reconstructed at about
the time of the second Punic war. It was composed of the three
hundred and fifty centuriae mentioned in ἓ 25, formed by
dividing each of the thirty-five tribes into five classeS, according
to wealth, and each of these classes into two centuriae according
to age—one of Seniores (above 45), one of J umore-3. To these
were added eighteen centuriae of young nobles who had not been
magistrates (g 17), and five centuriae of smiths, trumpeters and
citizens (called aerarii) who lacked the property qualification
for the regular classeS, making a total of three hundred and 31
seventy-three centuriae. This assembly could be summoned by
a dictator, consul or praetor. It met on the Campus MartiuS.
It elected consuls, praetors and censorS. It possessed full
rights of legislation, but almost never used them. It possessed
judicial authority in criminal cases», but had delegated this to
the standing courtS. It had the power of declaring war, but
had allowed the senate to usurp this function.

The same method of voting was used in all assemblies. Insa·
the comitia tributa the people arranged themselves by tribes
in enclosures (saepta) marked off by ropes or other barriers.
Each citizen was supplied with tickets marked ‘for' and ‘against'
