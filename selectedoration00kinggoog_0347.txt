CAP. 1, §g 1-2 ’323

After the senate adjourned Cicero addressed the people in the forum in
what is known as the fourth Philippic, covering‚ more briefly‚ much the
same gmund as the third.

With this oration should be read Ep. 21.

1. Frequentia vestrum incredibilis, QuiriteS‚ centieque tanta, 1
quantam meminisse nen videor, et alacritatem m1hi summam
defendendae rei publicae adfert et spem recuperandae. Quam-
quam animus mihi quidem numquam defuit, tempora defuerunt,

5 quae simul ac primum aliquid lucis ostendere visa sunt, princeps
vestrae libertatis defendendae fuI. Quod si id ante facere
cenatus essem, nunc facere nen possem. Hodierne enim die,
QuiriteS‚ ne mediocrem rem actam arbitremini, fundamenta
iacta sunt reliquarum actienum. Nam est hostis a senetu

ιο nendum verbe adpelletuS‚ sed re iam iudicatus Antenius. Nunc 2
