et hoc dilectu, quem in agro Piceno et Gallico Q. Metellus
habuit, et his copiis, quae a nobis cotidie comparantur, magno
opere contemno collectum ex senibus desperat18‚ ex agresti
5 luxuria, ex rusticis decoctoribus, ex iis, qui vadimonia deserere
quam illum exercitum maluerunt ; quibus ego non modo si
aciem exercitus nostri, verum etiam si edictum praetoris osten-
dero, concident. Hes, quos video volitare in foro, quos stare
ad curiam, quos etiam in senatum venire, qui nitent unguentIS,
ὀ qui fulgent purpura, mallem secum suos milites eduxisset 3 qui ·
si hic permanent, mementote non tam exercitum illum esse
nobis quam hos, qui exercitum deseruerunt, pertimescendos,
Atque hoc etiam sunt timendi magis, quod, quid cogitent, me

erns dilectu and copiis as well as levio-
nibus. Gallicanis legionibus: a small

ν standing army was kept ln Gallia Cisal-

pina in view of possible danger from
the Gauls. and to these troops Quintus
Metellus (as praetor) was adding rein-
forcements by a fresh levy.

2. agro Piceno et Gallico: point
out upon Map. The aver Gallicus is the
district lying along the coast north ot
Picenum. and once held by the Galli
Senones.

4. collectum: agrees with exercitum
in l. 1. senibus desperatis: the

veteratis or Sulla, of whom Sallust (Cat.·

28) says: quibus lubido atque luxuria
a maenis rapinis nihil reliqui fecerat.
ex agresti luxuria: ‘or boorish high-
livers;’ tor this use of the abstract noun
see on I. 18. 4, and give two examples.
5. vadimonia desueto. ete: ‘to
doeert their bonds [men] rather than,
etc.' Vadimonium was a promise,
secured by hail, to appear in court on
a fixed day, and vadimonium deserere·-
‘to forfeit bau) The plural is here
accommodated to that of maluerunt.
Η. qulbus ego α-ᾳαῑ, ει· eoo eie:
the Latin idiom prefers to put the rela-
tive in the subordinate clause: tr.. ‘and
they will collapse not merely if 1 show

-i.e.. it will be sufficient simply to read
them the riot act, without resorting to
force. This. of course, is hyperbolical.
for Catiline’s forces proved the following
spring at Pistoria that they could and
would fight. non modo . . . verum
etlam: with these correlatives a weaker
expression may be followed by a
stronger (α-Ι- Β), ‘not only . . . but also
. . . ‚' or a stronger by a weaker (A-i-b),
‘1 do not say . . . but . . . .’ Which
here? video volitare: translate the
infinitive by a present participle. which
might have been used in the Latin (A.
497, d: B. 337, 3: H. 613, 4; Η.-Β.
605, 1). Volitare in these orations has
always a contemptuous force.

9-11. The use of perfumes and the
wearing of colors in public excited the
contempt of the sober-minded Romane.
mallem: potential in mild statement
—-·1’d rather,' etc.; the tense retains its
proper force (A. 447, 1, note: B. 280, 4:
H. 556: H.—B. 518, b). eduxisset: see
A. 565, note 1: 442, b: B. 296, 1, a: H.
565. 2: 614. 1: H.-B. 519, 1, c. tuoe
milltes: ‘as his own corpS‚' in apposi-
tion to hos. l. 8. qul sl permanent:
indicative here suggests an almost causal
idea—⁴ since they remain!

12. pertimescendos esse: The sub·

them our army's array. but even ii 1 Jects are exercitum and hos.

show them the praetor’s proclamation '

13. hoo: abl. ot cause.
