122 ORATIO IN CATILINAM SECUNDA

10. Quartum genus est sane varium et mixtum et turbulen- 21

tum; qui iam pridem premuntur, qui numquam emergunt,
qui partim inertia, partim male gerendo negotio, partim etiam
sumptibus in vetere aere alieno vacillant, qui vadimoniis.
5 indiciis, proscriptione bonorum defetigati permulti et ex urbe
et ex agris se in illa castra conferre dicuntur. Hosce ego non
tam milites Ε acris quam infitiatores lentos esse arbitror. Qui
homines quam primum, si stare non possunt, corruant, sed ita,
ut· non modo civitas, sed ne vicini quidem proximi sentiant.

10 Nam illud non intellego, quam ob rem, si vivere honeste non

possunt, perire turpiter velint, aut cur minore dolore perituros

se cum multiS, quam si soli pereant, arbitrentur. Quintum 22

‘not only do men not seem. etc„ but
not even beasts (seem, etc.).’ Cicero
sometimes writes the full form, non
modo nom but when the predicate is
common to both clauses he more fre-
quently omits the second non, as here.
It makes a neater translation, however,
to connect the negative in ne . . .
quidem with the predicate: ‘Not only
men, but beasts as well, seem to me
unlikely to,' etc. Notice the difference
between this use or the correlatives and
that explained on 1. 10. 5. pecudes:
typical oi* patient suffering (cf. Isaiah
5327).

Explain reference and force οῗ the
pronouns so (3), idem (5), huic (10),
mi (13), hi (19), illorum, ista (31).

10. 1-12. Fourth class: Bankrupta or
both town and country—their condition is
hopeless and will not be improved bv a
revolution, 521.

1, 2. sane: two meanings (a) in-
tensive, ‘wholly,' ‘utterly;’ (b) conces-
sive, ‘tor all 1 care: ' which here? in
’1. 15? turbulentum: ‘heterogeneous.’
The three adj. are synonyma. See on 1.
5. 7. iam . . . premunturz ‘long
have been weighed down’ by debt (ior
tense see on 1. ὅ. 27).

3-5. qiu pai-tim . .
‘some oi whom . . . others.' vetere:
in its proper sense (see on ⁹. 28). vadi-

· partlm}

moniis . . . bonorum: ‘securities‚
judgments. execution ’-—the three steps
im legal proceedings against debtors: (1)
They had to furnish security for their
appearance on the day oi trial. (2)
J udgment was then pronounced against
them in due torm. (3) By warrant ot
the court their property was sold.
bonorum: substant. neut. pl.. caus-
ing no difficulty. as the two words were
formal legal phrase (see on 8. 18).
permulti: ‘in large numbersz' force
or per-‘l’ urbe et atris: ‘city and
country!

7. infitiatores lenton ‘shirking
deiaulters;’ i.e., persons who make all
sorts oi excuses tor not fulfilllng prompt-
ly their engagements. Cicero thinks
they will shirk their military duties in
the same way.

anaximene.. .sedne. ..

be supplied? In translating connect
the neg. with sentiant—⁴ be ignorant

10. illud: explained by the clauses
quamobrem...ve12·ntandcur...
arbitrentur: what kind of clauses are
these? si: ‘since‚' being almost causal
ln force though conditIonal in form
(cf. 8. 11). How does si . . . pereant. 1.
