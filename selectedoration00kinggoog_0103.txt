CAP. 6-7, gg 15-17

loquar, non ut odio permotus esse videar, quo debeo, sed ut
misericordia, quae tibi nulla debetur. Venisti paulo ante in
senatum. Quis te ex hac tanta frequentia, totque tuis amicis
5 ac necessariis salutavit? Si hoc post hominum memoriam
contigit nemini, vocis expectas contumeliam, cum sis gravissimo
indicio taciturnitatis oppressus? Quid, quod adventii tuo ista
subsellia vacuefacta sunt, quod omnes consulareS, qui· tibi
persaepe ad caedem constituti fuerunt, simul atque adsedistr,
1⁰ partem istam subselliorum nudam atque inanem reliquerunt,

quo tandem animo tibi ferundum putas? Servi mehercule 17

mei si me isto pacto metuerent, ut te metuunt omnes cives tui,

You are hated and despised bv all,
5516. 17.

7. 2. 3. quo debeo: sc. permotus
esse. ut: sc. permotus esse videar.
quae nulla: besides the adj8. ot quan-
tity. multi. pauci, etc.. nullus is put in
agreement with relatives and demon-
stratives where the whole and not a part
only is meant. Nullus is then equiv-
alent to an emphatic non. What other
word may be used tor non? Of. 1. 3.

4. hac unta: ‘this great: not ‘so
great’ (see on δ. 9).

6. contigit: generally used ot good
tortime, unless accompanled by a nega-
tive, as nemini here; for bad fortune
accidit is the usual word. cum: see
on ὅ. 2ο, and point out another example
in this chapter.

7. Quid. quod. etc.:
think of this, that, etc.?' For quid, see
on 8. 19: tor quod. on illa, 1. 21. Note
that in thIs use quid is often followed by
a second question, here quo tandem ani·
mo. etc.. 1. 11. ista subsellia: ‘the
benches nm vou' (see on 1. 2). The
senators sat on benches without backs.
probably in the order ot their rank, the
consulares together and near them the
praetorii, the class to which Catiline be-
longed. What sort ot a seat had the
consul?

8. tibi: agent. What would be
the regular construction? The dative

‘what do you

ot the agent is used by Cicero with
the gerundivo regularly (e.g. in l.
11), and the perfect participle tre-
quently‚ but with no other parts ot
the verb (A. 3⁷4, 375; Β. 189: Η. 4313

9. constituti ruerunt: not a mere

variation ior constituti sunt, though the ·

distinction cannot be expressed con-
cisely in English3 with suerunt the mean-
ing is ‘have been (but are no longer)
doomed;' with sum the words in paren-
thesis would not necessarily be implied
(A. 495. n.; H. 538, 1). adscensu: 'had
taken your seat near (ad-) them;’ for
the tense see A. 543; B. 287; Η. 602:
H.-B. 557.

11. quo . . . putu: ‘In what spirit,
pray‚ do you think you ought to take
(bear) this'?' mehercule: ‘by heavens;’
the full form, me Hercules juvet, meant
’so help me Hercules‚’ but the idea ot
invocation shrank with the words to the
meaning and form here used.

12. sl: notIee how tar it is crowded
from its proper place (where't) to make
servi emphatic. pacto2=mod0. metu-
erent: what time and thought does the
imperfect subj. express in conditional
sentences? (A. 517: B. 304: H. 579:
H.-B. 581). ut:
‘whem’ which here?
31 below. cives:
in ll. 14, 15.

with ind. ‘as’ or
So in lines 20 and
‘fellow citizens;' so
