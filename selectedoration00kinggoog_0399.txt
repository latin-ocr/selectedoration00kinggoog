ΕΡ. 17, g 1; 18, §g 1-2 375

5 intersim. Ne tsi videris multo ante providisse, quid impen-
deret, tum cum hinc profugisti. Quamquam haec etiam auditu
acerba sunt, tamen audire tolerabilius est quam videre. In
campo certe non fuisti, cum hora secunda· comitiis quaestoriis
institutis sella Q. Maximi, quem illi consulem esse dicebant,

ιο posita esset ; quo mortuo nuntiato sella sublatast. Ille autem,
qui comitiis tributis esset auspicatusr centuriata habuit, con-
sulem hora septima ¹ renuntiavit, qui usque ad K. Ian. esset,
quae erant futurae mane postridie. Ita Caninio consule scito
neminem prandisse: Nihil tamen eo consule mali- factum est ;

15 fuit enim mirifica vigilantia, qui suo toto consulatu somnum
non viderit. Haec tibi ridicula videntur ; non enim ades. 2

Quae si videreS, lacrimas non teneres. Quid, si cetera scribam?

tacere: ‘act.’ qui . . . intersim: the
reason tor the preceding clause.

5. ne: not the negative.

6. auditu} supine.

8, 9. campo: sc. Martio, where elec-
tions (comitiis) were held. Q. Maximi:
he had been consul since September. He
was Gaesar’s lieutenant in spain in 45.
mi: the Caesarians. dicebant: im-
plies Cicero's opinion 01 Maximus' title
to the consulship, which had been given
him by Caesar.

11. tributis (dat.). centuriata: the
individual voters were the· same for
either ot these assemblies (Abbott.
R. P. 1. 566)- but as electoral bodies the
comitia centuriata chose consuls, censors
and praetorS, while the comitia tributa
chose quaestors and aedues (see Intro-
duction? p. 53. §529-36). The meeting
which Cicero describes had been called
to elect quaestors, but was dissolved by
the death of the consul who was to have
presided. *Then, with no new taking ot
auspices, the same electors were called
by centuries to choose a consul to fill
the vacancy. . esset auspicatus: this
had been done shortly atter midnight by
the man who was to preside. emended
by an augur who interpreted the omens
as favorable or otherwise (cf. IV. 1. 12).
consulem . . . postridie: As Maximus

had died on the last day of his term
his successor had but a few hours to
serve, which affords an opening tor the
jests that follow.

12. hora septima: the hour be-
ginning at midday. At the end of
December the days are near their
shortest (the Romans called the winter
solstice bruma, ror brevima, ‘shortest ').
At the latitude ot Rome (41⁰ 54' N..
about the same as· that ot Chicago) the
sun rises on Dec. 31 at 7:30 and sets
at 4:36. giving nine hours of sixty
minutes each to be divided into the
twelve Roman hourS. The first, there·
rore. would extend from 7:30 to 8:15,
second 8:15-9200, third 9:00—9:45‚
fourth 9:45-loz30, fifth 10:30-11:15.
sixth 11:15—12 noon, seventh 12:00-
12:45, and so on. The hours oi the
night would each be 75 mInutes long.
At the summer solstice these figures
would be reversed, and at the equinoxes

in March and September the hours, day '

and night. would be oi 60 minutes each.
13. caninio: C. Caninius Rebilus,
the consul thus elected: a novus homo,
14. nemnem prandisse: as his
term extended only from noon to mid-
night it did not include the breakfast

honr: nor, ror the same reason, did the
consul sieep (l. 15).
