trast between the two members of the
sentence in their subjects (vir and nos),
appositives (privatus and consedes),
objects (Gracchum and Catilinam),
participial modifiers (mediocriter labe-
factantem and orbem vastare . . ο cupiene
tem). and verbs (interfecit and perfere-
mus).

18. P. Scipio Nasica was at the head
oi the optimates who (133) killed Ti.
Sempronius Gracchus,

19. privatus: Though pontifex max-
imus, Nasica held no political office at the
time ot the death ot Gracchus. Privatus
is opposed in meaning to manistratus,
the general term for political officiale,
and here in particular to consules.

20. orbem terrae: ‘the circle of
land' around the Mediterranean, ‘the
whole earth!

21. illa: ‘the following precedents’
explained by the clause quod . . . occidit
(a 297, b, ος Β. 246, 2:11. 507; Η.-Β.
· 273, a). The plural ie used either to
imply that more precedents might be
given, or with deliberate exaggeration.
nimis antiqua: ‘as too ancient.’

22. praetereo: Though he says *Ι
pass over.' the mere mention of the case
called it before his hearer's minds. This
¹8 a favorite device of Cicero’s. SD.
Mum: Maelius was a rich plebeian

accused of courting the favor of the
people, with a view to making himself
king, and was summoned before th'e
dictator Cincinnatus to answer to the
charge. On his hesltating to obey he
was killed by Ahala, the maci-ster equitum.
novis rebus: See A. 367: B. 187
11, a; H. 426: H.-B. 364, 1. For mean-
ing see phrase in Vocabulary under
novus.
23. ista: ‘such,’ not used of an op-
ponent here, and so not contemptuous
(see notes on 2 and 15). Note the strict
use of the ‘demonstrative oi the second
person’: bravery on the part of such
men as you (senators), in earlier times.

26. consultum: ‘decree.“ For the
formalities attending the passage of a
’consultum,' and the distinction between
a consultum and auctoritas see Abbott,
R. P. 1. ξξ275, 287. Sallust (Cat. 29)
says it conferred the right ‘to raise an
aimy, conduct war, restrain allies and
citizens ln every manner, and hold su·
preme authority, military and judi-
cial! .
27. consillum: ‘wisdom,' ⁰advice,'
‘statesmanship.' In how many mean-
ings is consilium used in this chapter?
huius ordinis: the senate.

Explain the case of patientia (1. 1),
consula (7). noete (9), consilli, quem

'⁷¹10 sold grain to the poor at low rates (10), viri, rei publicae (14), consulet
during the famine of 439. He was (21), and mood ot coercerent (25).
