M. TULLT CICERONIS

PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO

AD CAESAREM

Inmonncronr N om——In 49, at the outbreak of the civil war between
Caesar and Pompey, the province Africa was in charge of Q. Ligarius,
who had gone out as legatus with the propraetor C. Considius and had
shown such ability that on the retirement of Considius he was left for
the time in control. Later a former governor of Africa, P. Attius
Varus, a partisan of Pompey, was forced to fiee from Italy and came
to Africa, where he assumed the leadership with the consent of Ligarius.
Still later L. Aelius Tubero, also a Pompeian, was commissioned governor
of Africa by the senate, and went with his son Quintus to take posses-
sion. Varus, however, refused to let them land, though the younger
Tubero was ill, and both father and son thereupon joined Pompey in
Greece.

After the battle of Pharsalus, though Pompey himself was utterly
defeated, and soon after lost his life, his friends in Africa continued to
oppose Caesar, and did not yield till almost annihilated in the battle of
Thapsus. All this time Ligarius was acting as a subordinate under the
orders of Varus. He finally was captured. Caesar spared his life, but
forbade his return to Rome.

In 46 repeated appeals were made for his pardon, which was opposed
by the younger Tubero on the ground that Ligarius had continued to
fight, with Juba and other foreigners, against his country. Cicero made
an appeal to Caesar in private, and finally, at a hearing in the forum,
delivered this oration. Its presentation of the case, with its fine satire
directed against Tubero and its appeal to the Dictator’s magnanimity,
was successful, and Ligarius was pardoned—only to engage a year and
a half later in the conspiracy against Caesar's life.
