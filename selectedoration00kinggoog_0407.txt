c. SALLUSTI CRTSPT
BELLUM CATILTNAE

The historian Sallust was a younger contemporary of Caesar and
Cicero, having been born in 86. He belonged to a plebeian family but
entered early upon the cursus honoram, reaching the quaestorship about
60 and again in 49, the tribunate of the plebs in 52 and the praetorship
in 47. He seems not to have held the consulship, but was governor
(propraetor‘f) of Numidia about 45. ’

Sallust took an active if not a prominent part in the stirring events
of his time. He was a follower of Cicero's enemy, Clodius, and in 50,
when expelled from the senate for his disgraceful life, he joined Caesar,
whom he served faithfully throughout the civil war. After his master's
death he lived in quiet retirement, enjoying the wealth gained in his
governorship and devoting himself to his historical work.

Of his books we have only the Catilina and a history of the war with
Jugurtha. In these he tells of contemporary events, of many of 'which
he was an eyewitnesS, and seems to have taken great pains to give the
facts correctly. He is not careful, however, to preserve the natural
sequence of events.

His style differs from that of Cicero in its evident attempt at brevity‚
in its use of obsolete or archaic words and formS‚ in its imitation of Greek
phrases and constructions, and in its free use of such constructions as the
ablative absolute and the historical infinitive. For example he writes
-vos and -vom for classical -vus, -vum (e.g. novos, novom), vorto and voster
for verto, vester, etc., and uses much more freely than Cicero such endings
as -umus and -undus (for -imus, andus). For color, honor, etc., he writes
colos, Ῐιοηοθς the genitive of senatus is senati ; the 3d plural perfect indica-
tive ends almost always with -ere, ”

Common features of his style are antithesis and chiasmus, coordination
of indicative and historical infinitive in the same sentence, the use of a
plural verb with a singular (collective) subject, the constant employment
of such introductory words as at, iyitur, interea, the correlation of pars . . .
