PRO ARCHIA· POETA

Furium, moderatissimos homines et continentissimo& ex hoc
fortissimum virum et illis temporibus doctissimum, M. Cato-
nem illum senem3 qui profecto si nihil ad percipiendam colen-
damque virtutem litteris adiuvarentur, numquam se ad earum
studium contulissent. Quodsi non hic tantus fructus osten-
deretur, et si ex his studiis delectatio sola peteretur, tamen, ut
opinor, hanc animi remissionem humanissimam ac liberalissi-
mam iudiearetis. Nam ceterae neque temporum sunt neque
aetatum omnium neque locorum3 at haec studia adulescentiam
alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis per-
fugium ae solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt
foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.

Hannibal. He was a devoted friend and

'student of literature and a close friend

or C. Laelius: the latter, as well, as L.
Furius Philus, was a man of great refine-
ment and learning. These three men
