to illustrate the orator's earlier style and his methods as a
prosecutor. This is followed by three speeches of the latest
period—two Caesareans and the fourth Philippic. The twenty-
one letters also cover a wide range of time and subject matter,
though special prominence is given to the year of exile.

which it is believed will meet the approval of teacherS. The
text is given in full, except for a few chapters which have no

orations ; and this reading may come at the opening of the
