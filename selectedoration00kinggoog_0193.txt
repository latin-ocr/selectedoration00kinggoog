cAP. 10-11. §g 21-33 175

Romanorum et tantam conspirationem bonorum omnium con-
fringere et labefactare possit.

11. Quae cum ita sint, pro imperio, pro exercitii, pro provin- 23
cia, quam neglexi, pro triumpho ceterisque laudis insignibus,
quae sunt a me propter urbis vestraeque salsitis cfistodiam
repudiata, pro clientelis hospitiisque provincialibus quae
tamen urbanis opibus non minore labore tueor quam comparo,
pro his igitur omnibus rebus, pro meis in vos singularibus

38. eonii-ingere · et labetactare:
‘break and loosen:’ the metaphor ls
from a stake driven into the ground. the
upper part broken. and the lower worked
loose. labetactaret for formation see
on ΙΙ. ’1. 24ς Cicero does not use labe-
tacere.

,ΟΙ you Ι ask only that you remember,
5523, 24.

11. 1. pro: ‘in place οῖ’ (distinguish
from force in 111. 11. 1). imperio:
here, in its technical sense, the power ογ
virtue of which the general controlled his
army ογ martial law. Ῑι was vested in
the chier magistrates. but its use was
restricted within the city. Cicero was
not going to govern a province. and
hence would not have an army or the
imperium (·=‘military command'). pro
provincia: Each of the ten chief mag-
istratoe (two consuls and eight praetors)
had the right to go. at the expiration
of his term of office. to one oi the prov-
inces as governor. The two consular
provinces were fixed upon ογ the senate
before the election oi the consuls who
were to govern them, and atter their
election the consuls settled ογ lot or by
mutual agreement which of the two
each should take. The consular prov-
inces oi 62 were Macedonia and Cisal-
pine Gaul, οἱ which Cicero gave up the
tormer to Antony (ct. Ι. 18. 19) and
the latter to Metellus Celer. By so
doing he lost, of course, the chance ot
a triumph, etc.

4. clientem: Provincial communi-
ties otten attached themselves as clients

to their former governors, who thus be·
came their patroni and looked after
their interests in the capital. Such con-
nections were very advantageous to the
patroni and. ογ declining a province,
Cicero had given up the best oppor-
tunity of forming them. hospitus:
‘guest triendships: ‘fraternal ties! Hos-
pitium was a relation entered into with
each other ογ two citizens oi different
state& at the time when there were no
international relations, These 'guest
friends’ (hospites) were bound to ex·
tend to each other protection and aid,
very much as members or our great
secret eumenes—Masone, Oddfellows,
etc. The relation descended irorn father
to son, and was vouched ior ογ a t'oken
(tessera) agreed upon ογ the original
pair. In course of time it became com-
mon ior a community. when it wished
to honor highly an individual ot an-
other community. to declare him the
hospes of the whole community. 01
course the governors ot provinces en-
joyed exceptional opportunities for
forming such relations with both indi-
viduals and communities. provincian-
bus: ‘in the provinces)

5. tamen: here as often (cf. 4. 17)
tamen answers to a concession implied
in a preceding word (provincialibus)—
⁴ (although these relations are with
provinciale, and Ι have declined a prov-
ince), still I maintain them with no less
labor than 1 secure them ογ means oi
my influence in the city! opibus:
expresses means with both verbS.

6-9. igitur: as in 1. 4. 14. pro .
