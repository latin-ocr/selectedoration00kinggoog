ROMAN CRIMIN AL TRIALS

1. All criminal cases were tried by the standing courts (quaestiones §1 '

perpetuae), as remodeled by Sulla. We know of six of these, de repetundis
(misgovernment), de sicariis et veneficis (murder), de ambitu (illegal can-
vassing), de peculatu (embezzlement), de mie-state (treasoni. de falso
(forgery), but there were probably others. Cases submitted to these courts 2
were tried by judge and Jury. The official title of the judge was quaesitor,-
the jury as a body was termed consilium, while the individuale composing

it were called iudices. Whenever‚ therefore, the plural iudices occurs in a
phrase relating to a criminal trial it must be translated ‘jurors’ or ‘jury,’
never ‘judgea’

ΙΙ. The praetors, eight in number, were the Roman judges· but as two 3
of these, the praetor urbanus and praetor pereqrinus, were engaged with civil
cases, six only were free to preside over the criminal courts, and to these
six were assigned by lot the six courts mentioned by name above. Over 4
the remaining eourts presided specially appointed officers (usually ex-
aediles), who had the special title iudex quaestionis as well as the general ⁴
one quaesitor. The duty of the judge was merely that of a presiding officer.
He was bound to'see that the provisions of the law were strictly complied
with, but was not allowed to direct or control the decision, which ‘rested
entirely with the iudices.

III. The jurors were Roman citizens living in the city itself, or in its 5
immediate vicinity, and serving without pay. No one was eligible for jury
duty who was invested with any of the higher offices of state, or who had
, ever been convicted of any offense affecting his standing as a citizen of
full rights (civis optimo iure, p. 47, ἃ 2). Α list of men eligible for jury
duty (album iudicum) was made up by the praetor urbanus at the beginning
of his term, and was valid for the year. Of the jurors one-third had to be 6
senators and two—thirds equestriansz of the latter class, one-half (i. e.‚ one-
third of the whole number) had to be tribuni aerarii, district presidents.

⁴ Not much is known about these, but, as they were elected by the tribes,

one-third of the jury was, indirectly, at least, elective.

IV. A suit was begun by the accuser making application to the judge ⁷
of the proper court for leave to bring the charge. As two or more persons
might desire to prosecute the same man on the same charge, it was some-
times necessary for the judge to decide who should be the chief accuset
