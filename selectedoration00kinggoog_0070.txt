sided over by an actual tribune. They were the most powerful
Officers of the state, though their power was of a negative kind,
and they had few specified dutieS. Their authority was con-
fined to the city itself, and their persons were sacred, i.e., it was
death to offer violence to a tribune in the exercise of his author-

eagerly sought, for the commons took great delight in the showS,
and the aedile who gratified them with expensive games would
reap his reward when he ran for another office.
