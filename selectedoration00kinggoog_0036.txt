summoned by Cicero for the purpose, bore witness to the
attempt, and helped to spread the news through the city.
'l'he first oration against Catilina—On the same day 42

(November 8th) Cicero assembled the senate in tne temple
of Jupiter Stator, on the northern slope of the Palatine hill
and probably within the original fortifications of the ancient
city. Here lived Cicero and Catiline, here lived the aristoc-
racy, and hence is derived our word palace. The senators
· came in large numbers. The late hour of the day, the unusual
place of meeting, and the supposed subject of deliberation‚
excited their liveliest anticipations. Among them carne Cati-
line, undismayed by the watchmen already patrolling the
street8‚ by the guards already posted, by the crowds of people
anxiously running to and fro, by the band of knights who
surrounded the senate fully armed and who regarded him
with no friendly eyes. As he made his way toward his usual
place, where as ex-praetor he sat near the ex-consuIS, no one
spoke to him, no one greeted him, and as he took his seat
those near him rose from theirs and left him alone. Cicero, 43
losing his sels-control at this exhibition of Cati-line's effrontery,
broke forth in a fiery speech, upbraided him with the events
of the last two nightS, and demanded that he quit the city.
Even now Catiline attempted a defense. He begged the sen-
ators not to believe the charges too hastily: he was sprung
from such a family, had so lived from his youth that he might
hope for every success ς they could not think that he, a patri-
cian, needed the overthrow of the republic when Cicero, an
immigrant into Rome, put himself forward as its savior.
He was going on with further insults when the senate inter-
rupted him with cries of hosti-3, parricida. He rushed from
the temple, and, after a last meeting with his accompliceS,
he left the city the same night to join Manlius, His friends
spread the report that ⁴ he was going into exile at Massilia, a
report that Catiline craftily confirmed by letters written to
prominent men at Rome.
