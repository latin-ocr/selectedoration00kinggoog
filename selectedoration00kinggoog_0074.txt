34 INTRODUOHON

These ceremonies were directed by various priestS‚ or codegesSG
of priestS, religious guilds and societieS. The priests, however,
had none of the characteristics which we are accustomed to asso—
ciate with the word. They did not form an exclusive class
or caste, nor did they require preliminary training or education.
They were not excluded from other offices; on the contrary, the
more important priesthoods were filled by the greatest states—
men and generals—Julius Caesar was Pontifex Maximus while
he was fighting in Gaul.

'l'he Pontificem—The most important of the priestly 81 ³

colleges was that of the Pontifices, who had the supervision of
the whole state religion, including general oversight of all the
other ministers of religion, thus exerting a vast political influ-

and importance in Rome. He was originally chosen by his
colleagueS, who had formed a sels—perpetuating body, but in 82
Cicero’s time all were appointed by the vote of seventeen
tribes selected by lot from the thirty-five. He held office
for life, lived in the ancient palace of the kingS, the Reqia,
appointed the fifteen flamines (priests of particular gods),
selected the Vestal VirginS‚ superintended religious marriages
and other important family ceremonieS, and with the aid of his
colleagues regulated and published the calendar.

The Augures. —Next m dignity came the college of augure,83
also fifteen 111 number, and elected m the same way as the pontif·-
ices. They were charged with the interpretation of the
auspices (auspicia), which played a very important part in
political affairs. The auspices were entirely distinct from omens
(omina) ‚ being simply answers ‘Yes' or ‘ No' to questions put to the
gods in regard to the propriety of some contemplated act which

was distinctly specified. Custom required that the gods 84 ’

should thus be consulted on all important public occasions.
Favorable auspices, i.e., the permission of the godS, were
required before the comitia could be held, the senate convoked,
