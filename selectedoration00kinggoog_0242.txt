M. TULLT CICERONIS
PRO ARCHIA POETA ORATIO
AD IUDICES

...-

lumenve-rom N o'rE.. Archias was a Greek, born about 120, at Antioch,
in Syria. In the schools of his native city he received a liberal education,
and showed unusual talent as a poet. While yet a mere youth, about
103 Β. C„ he left home', visited the cities of Western Asia, Greece and
Southern Italy, and won no small fame through his poetical ability,
being particularly skillful in impromptu composition. Several cities
of Magna Graecia bestowed citizenship upon him. In 102 he arrived
in Rome, whither his fame had already come. The foremost Romans
gave him a cordial welcome‚ especially the Luculli, from which family he
afterwards took the gentile name of Licinius. As a young man he wrote
a poem celebrating the victories of Marius and Catulus over the Teutones
and Cimbri, and later honored Lucullus by a poem on the Mithridatio
War.

Shortly after his arrival in Rome he accompanied M. Lucullus to
Sicily, and on the return journey visited Heraclea, where L. Lucullus,
father of MarcuS, probably lived in exile. This city presented him with
citizenship, doubtless through the influence of the Luculli, and out of
his friendship for them Archias thereafter represented himself as a citizen
of Heraclea. By the Lex Plautia Papiria, passed in 89, Archias obtained
citizenship at Rome, assuming the full name of Aulus Licinius Archias.
He subsequently accompanied L. Lucullus the younger on various cam—
paigns, being thereby prevented from getting his name on the lists of the
censors.

In the year 62 Grattius, a man otherwise unknown, brought against
Archias the charge of assuming citizenship illegally‚ on the ground that
his name did not appear on the census lists, and that he could not prove
his citizenship at Heraclea. The case was in reality prosecuted to annoy
