M. TULH CICERONIS
IN O. VERREM ACTIO SECUNDA

LIB. V cc. 61-66

The effect of Cicero's opening address (Aetio I) on court and people
was such that the presiding praetor adj ourned the court. Hortensius,
realizing that the plan for postponement was defeated and that his client
had no chance of escape on a fair trial, threw up the case and Verres
went into exile.

Actio II was never presented orally in court, but in it Cicero has
assembled the facts on which he rested his case. It is perhaps the most
complete and terrible arraigmnent of a corrupt and oppressive ruler
ever presented. Burke's impeachment of Warren- Hastings is the nearest
modern parallel, and no doubt many features of it were suggested by
this—for Burke drew much of his inspiration as an orator from the classice.

Aetio ΙΙ contains five ‘books:'- (1) de praetura urbana (Verres’ praetor-
ship at Rome): (2) de iurisdictione Siciliensi (his administration of justice
in Sicily); (3) de srummzto (the grain supply); (4) de siquis (the works
of art which he stole); (5) de suppliciis (the unlawful punishment of
Roman citizens).

Though not presented in court the several ‘books' are composed in
the form of orations, with addresses to the president of the court and
to the iurors and an occasional apostrophe to the defendant, now in
exile. The brief extract given below is found nesr- the close of book 5,
and marks the climax of a most thrilling denunciation. Its vividness
and intensity are almost overpowering.
