blica sentiat.

Polliceor hoc vobis, patres conscripti, tantam

in nobis consulibus fore diligentiam, tantam in vobis auctori-
tatem, tantam in equitibus Romanis virtiitem, tantam in
omnibus bonis consensionem, ut Catilinae profectione omnia
patefacta, inlustrata, oppressa, vindicata esse videatis.

Hisce ominibus, Catilina, cum summa rei publicae salute, 33
cum tua peste ac pernicie cumque eorum exitio, qui se tecum
omni scelere parricidioque iunxerunt, proficiscere ad impium
bellum ac nefarium. Tc, Iuppiter, qui isdem quibus haec

two knights to assassinate Cicero (4.
19-26). circumstare: ‘surround’ for
the purpose of intimidation-not greatly
different ⁴in force from obsidere, next
line. tribunal praetoris urbani: The
city praetor seems to have had a fixed
place for his judgm‘ent-seat in the forum,

while the other praetors set up their -
,tribunals wherever it was convenient.

cum gladiis: see on 6. 22. Notice in
these lines the reference to the three
departments of government—executive,
judicial, legislative.

16. manculos: hammers. the houow
heads of which were filled with tow and
pitch. They were thrown upon the
roofs while the faces were applied below.

19. nobis consulibus: Cicero's col-
league, C. Antonius Hybrida, was in
sympathy with the conspirators. To
prevent his active opposition Cicero
yielded to him his own claim to a pro-
consulship for the following year. He
promises here the loyalty of both con-
suls in the hope of committing Antony
still further to his policy of non-resist-
ance. In this plural, with vobis (the
senators), equitibus and omnibus bonis.
the orator endeavors again to show how
general is the support he can command.

21. bonis: see on 1. 5. Observe how
the different orders of the state are
mentioned. protectione: The abl. of

time is common ln such words as anno,
die, hora, etc. (A. 423, 1; Β. 230. 1:
H. 486, 1; Η.-Β. 439); less so with
words which do not themselves suggest
the idea oi time.

22. patefacta. etc.: The four parti-
ciples are to be taken in two groups of
two each, a very common arrangement
in Cicero, This may be brought out in
English by inserting ‘not only' before
cataracta and ‘but' also' before oppressa.

Go, and man the vods destrov nou!

23. Hiscet form? (A. 146. n. 1: B.
87, footnotel: H. 178, 3; Η.-Β. 138.
2. c). ominibus: explained by the
three cum- phrases that follow.

25. omni: ‘every sort of‚’ a very
common meaning in both singular and
plural.

26. Tu: subject of arcebis, l. 30, and
mactabis, l. 33. Iuppiter: He turns to
the statue near him. isdem . . . aut-
piens: We should expect isdem aus-
pcciis quibus. but in Latin it is a regular
usage to incorporate the antecedent in
the relative clause (A. 307. b; Β. 251. 4:
H. 399. 3; H.·B. 284, 6). Things done
‘under the same auspices' must be done
at the same time: and the words. there-
fore. are equivalent to eodem tempore.
This is. of course, an exaggeration. as
the temple was not vowed‚ much less
