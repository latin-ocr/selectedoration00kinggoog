THE ROMAN OOMMONWEALTH 65

magistrates inaugurated, battles fought, or any act affecting
the commonwealth performed. These questions the gods
would answer only when put to them by a duly authorized
person, and the answers were given by the peculiar chirp or
flight of birds The right to put the questions for the state85
(auspicia publica) was vested in each of the higher magistrateS,
who was said habere auspicia‚· the interpretation was a science
(ius auqum'um), the special study and care of the augurs.
Magistrates and augurs were therefore dependent upon each
other; neithe'r alone could get the information desired.

For taking the auspices an open space was marked out by 86
the augurs, called templum, the original sense of the word not
implying at all a sacred building. The proper templum for
auspicia publica was the auyuraculum upon the Capitol, but for
convenience other places, e.g., the Rostra in the forum, the hortus
Scipionis in the Campus MartiuS, and the buildings erected as
homes of the gods (templa, in our sense), were ‘inaugurated,'
but only by direct permission of the auspices taken in the
auquraculum. similarly, generals before going on a campaign 87
took the auspices on the Capitol, and were said to ‘carry their
auspices' with them; if they were unsuccessful they were
thought to have ‘lost their auspiceS,' and had in early days to
return to Rome for new ones (auspicia repetere). The incon-
venience of this rule led to the invention of a new method of
taking auspices, by watching the feeding of sacred chickens
which the general took along ·with him wherever he went.
Hence the classification of magistrates in ·§ 45, ΙΙΙ.

To both the augur and the magistrate the auspices were 2288
source of great political power. So minute and intricate were
the rules and regulations of augury that a zealous augur could
pick a flaw in almost any auspiceS, and thus effectually prevent
action on the part of magistrate, senate and people. And,
besides, it was a principle of augural law, confirmed by statute
law, that no action could be taken by a magistrate if he was
notified that another was engaged in taking auspices This
