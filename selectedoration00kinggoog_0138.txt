ORATIO IN

CATILINAM SECUNDA

desperent se id, quod conantur, consequi posse: primum
omnium me ipsum vigilare, adesse, providere rei publicae ;
deinde magnos animos esse in bonis viris, magnam concordiam,
magnas praeterea militum copias 3 deos denique 'inmortalis
10 huic invicto popule, clarissimo imperio, pulcherrimae urbi
contra tantam vim sceleris praesentis auxilium esse laturos,
Quodsi iam sint id, quod summo furore cupiunt, adepti, num
illi in cinere urbis et in sanguine civium, quae mente conscele-
rata ac nefaria concupiverunt, consules se aut dictatores aut
ιο etiam reges sperant futuros? Non vident id se cupere, quod si
adepti sint, fugitivo alicui aut gladiatori concedi sit necesse?

times too ot other words. What is the
regular construction? honores: ‘pub-
lic office' (ct. consule& dictatores, 1. 14).
A Roman’s political career was called
cursus honorum (see on 1. 11. 19). per-
turbata: sc. re publica3 opposed to
quieta above. What construction? hoc
praecipiendum: ‘this warning should
be given;' hoc is explained by the infin-
itive clauses in ll. 7-11. Ut desperent
expresses the purpose of praecipiendum
——·that they may lay aside the hope
of being able to gain what they are
attempting.’ scfflcet=seire licet: ‘any
one may know‚' 'seli-evidently' (ct.
videlicet, Ι. 8. 11). ,

6, 7. primum omniumt see on 8.
18. In this phrase the genitive plur.
neuter is common as a substantive, the
gender being suggested by primum.
Note the series primum. deinde, denique,
introducing co-ordinate expressions·
vigilare. with all the infinitives to esse
laturos, is appositive to hoc, l. 4.

9, 10. magnas copias: sc. adesse,
‘are at hand,' from esse. l. 8, as maluis-
sent from voluissent 8. 23. This use of a
verb (esse) with several words (animo-³,
concordiam. copias), to one of which it
does not strictly apply, is called zeugma.
invicto: ¹ invincible.' lit. ¹ unconquered :'
the first meaning is an interence only
from the second.

11. tantam vim: sc. quanta est.
This slight ellipsis atter tantus is found

in English after ‘such' (‘such an elo-
quent addressl’) and need not be indi·-
cated in the translation. What other
words are used in the same way? See
on Ι. 7. 14. praesentis: ‘in person‚'
with deos.

.12. Quodsi: how does the quod differ
in construction from the quod in quod
si, 8. 22? summo rurore: abl. ot
manner. Why may the preposition be
here omitted? num: be sure to indi-
cate in the translation the answer that
is expected.

13. quae: ‘things which;' note that
the antecedents cinere (cinis) and san-
quine are masculine. while the relative
is neuter: both antecedentS, however.
denote things without life, and in such
cases a relative (or predicate adj.) may
be neuter.

14. commea, etc.: see note on hono-
res, 1. 3.

15, 16. non for nonne is used in
questions ot indignant surprise only.
quod si adepti . . . concedi sit ne-
cesse: ‘which‚ if tor the moment gained,
must be surrendered, ' etc.: quod is really
object ot adepti sint (ct. 8. 6). though the
English idiom connects it with concedi,
etc. rugitivo: ‘runaway slave' always,
Cicero means that lt this class should
succeed in establishing a new order of
things, it would have in turn to yield to

ira. still lower class—that or mere brute
orce.
