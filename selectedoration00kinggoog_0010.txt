4 · PREFACE

third year, or, if the teacher finds it more convenient, at the
end of the second. The notes and grammatic'al references
have been made sufficiently full for such use.

In regard to the text the same principles have been fol-
lowed which were adopted for the original edition. With very
slight exceptions the standard text of C. F: W. Mueller and his
. associates is used. The employment of italics and brackets to
indicate variations from manuscript readings has been dis-
carded, and the few sentences in which the readings are hope-
lessly corrupt or obscure have simply been omitted altogether ς
all this, to quote the original Preface‚ ‘in order to furnish a
clear, straightforward, readable text which will render unneces-
sary the suggestion or discussion of various readings.’

For the convenience of both student and teacher the notes
are placed on the same page with the text, but a separate text
is supplied for use in the classroom. The notes are intended to
afford the necessary help on difficulties of text, supply directly
or by reference such collateral information as is needed and so
far as possible lead the student to some appreciation of the
great orator's language and style and the life and thought of
his time. They should be not merely glanced at for momentary
aid in translation, but studied thoroughly, and the student
should be held rigidly responsible for their content.

The attempt has been made to maintain throughout the
principles of annotation enunciated in the first edition: (1)
The notes are brief and to the point, and are positive. In most
caseS, even where controversy is possible, only that explanation
is given which seems to the editor most satisfactory ς for the
discussion which is so stimulating and profitable in college -
classes is likely to result only in confusion to younger students„
