THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 63

served, and the relations between them were naturally close
and confidential.

Under certain circumstances the senate might have the 75
imperium conferred upon inferior magistrates or even private
citizens, and send them to the provinces as promagistrateS,
though they had not filled the magistracies themselves. ·

No person having the imperium was allowed to enter Rome,
and promagistrates were not permitted to return from their
provinces cum imperio until relieved by their successors. In
case of a proconsul's withdrawal before the arrival of his
successor his duties devolved upon the quaestor.

'l'he cursus Honorum—The road to the gold mine of the 77
provinces was not, however, a short and easy one. The laws
fixed directly or indirectly the age at which each magistracy
could be held, and provided that they should be taken in regular
order. This fixed order was called the cursus honorum; the
first step was the quaestorship, legal age thirty; then the
praetorship, legal age forty; then the consulship, legal age
forty-three. Two years had to elapse after one curule office 78
had been held before the next higher could be taken, no matter
what was the age of the candidate. A man standing for (or
elected to) an office at the earliest date permitted by these
rules was said to have stood (or been elected) suo anno. An
aspirant for political honors liked to hold the aedileship (see
§65 [d]) or the tribuneship between the quaestorship and consul-
ship, but was not required to do so.

The Roman commonwealth was conceived of as founded by79
the gods, and continuously and directly dependent upon, them.
The national religion was a stately ceremonial having little to
do with the lives and morals of the citizens, but maintained
upon a lavish scale for the purpose of securing tho favor of the
gods, and with it the perpetuity of the state.
