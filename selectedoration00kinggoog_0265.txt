ROMAN cmm-NAL TR1ALS 245

(aecusator), and who the supporters (subscriptores). When this had been
determined by due inquiry (divinatio), the chief accuser made the formal
charge (nomen detulit); and the judge, having first notified the accused
(reus), and made sure that the accuser was a Roman citizen, duly registered
the case (nomen recepit) upon his docket. He then fixed the day of trial,
usually at an interval of ten days, and had the accused arrested and held
for trial, or admitted him to bail.

V. On the day of trial the proper number (unknown to us) of jurors 8
was chooen by lot from those not already engaged in other trials‚ but both
accuser and accused had the privilege of challenging (reiectio) a certain
number without assigning any cause. Those remaining (consilium iudicum)
were sworn, and the trial oommenced. If it was not finished on the first
day the court adjourned'to the next but 'one (perendie), and so on until the
arguments of the counsel (altercatio) were finished and the evidence was
all in. The judge then called upon the jurors for their verdict, and 9
apparently renewed their oaths. Each juror wrote his decision (sententia)
secretly upon a tablet in one ofthree forms: A. (absolvo), ‘not guilty;’ C.
(condemno), ‘guilty;’ or N. L. (non liquet), ‘not proven! The verdict was
determined by a majority of votes, or, if there was a tie, the verdict was
given in favor of the defendant. If the majority voted N. L. the case was
tried agaim otherwise there was no appeal from the judgment of a quaestio.

VI. It will be noticed immediately that this procedure differs widely 10
from ours. There was no professionally trained judge to sift the evidence
and sum it up for the jury. The quaesitores were changed from year to year,
and the praetore at least were more apt to be skillful politicians than learned
jurists. There was no class of professional advocates taking fees and 11
living by their profession. Any citizen might accuse or defend any other,
and, as a high reputation as a successful pleader helped a man to political
distinction, many did s0. Thus the relations of counsel to clients rested
more than now upon the grounds of personal feeling. Again it not infre- 12
quently happened that collusion existed between the accuser and the
accused. The. former frequently played into the hands of the latter by
suppressing evidence and conducting the case without energy (praevari-
catio), and hence the chief security for an honest prosecution lay in the
personal hostility of the two. Then no bounds were set to the matter of 13
an advocate’s speech. The time might be limited by the judge or by agree-
ment, but the only measure of relevancy was the patience of the jury.

It is safe to say that a modern judge would not allow half of any of Cicero’s
speeches to reach the ears of the jury. Lord Brougham declares that not
one—sixth of the oration for Archias would be admissible in an English
court. Great importance was therefore attached to an advocate’s skill
