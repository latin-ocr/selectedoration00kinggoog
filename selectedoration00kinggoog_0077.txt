 

THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH 67

811 departments of state, to be in itself the government with
the magistrates as its servants

One source of its power was its membership, the ordo senato· 94
rius described in g 14. All the higher magistrates became
members of the senate for life as soon as their term of office
ended, and all but the quaestors were senators before their term
began. The senate thus contained by indirect electiori all the

between the abdication of one board of censors (ἓ 56) and the
election of their successors. In this period of from two-and-
one-half to three-and-one-half years there was at all times
money to receive and to pay out on orders and contractS, with.
which the magistrates for the time had had nothing to do. To
the senate. therefore, as the one continuous body, fell the right
