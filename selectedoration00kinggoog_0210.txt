pauca dicam. Potest enim hoc dici, belli genus esse ita
necessarium, ut sit gerendum, non esse ita magnum, ut
sit pertimescendum. In quo maxime laborandum est, ne
ὕ forte ea vobis, quae diligentissime providenda sunt, con-
temnenda esse videantur. Atque ut omnes intellegant me
L. Lucullo tantum impertire laudis, quantum forti viro et
sapienti homini et magno imperatori debeatur, dico eius ad-

this chapter were briefly as follows: In
⁷4 M. Aurelius Ootta, governor of Bi-

thynia, was defeated and shut up in
Chalcedon by Mithridates, and was
finally relieved by Lucullus. The cam-
paign then became centered about the
town of Cyzicus, on an island in the
Propontis, which Mithridates fiercely
besieged, the people making heroic re—
sistance. Lucullus cut off Mithridates’
supplies, and the latter began a retreat
in the spring of 73. He went to Lamp-
sacus, embarked his troops there, and
sailed with the greater part to Nico-
media. However, he sent back 10,ooo
men in fifty ships under three com‹
manders sent him by Sertorius, who
were to hurry to Italy and renew the
civil war. Lucullus assembled a squad-
ron, defeated part of the fleet off
Tenedos, and annihilated the main force
near Lemnos. When Mithridates re-
ceived news of this he started to
Pontus. but his fleet was shattered by
storms. He then appealed to Tigranes
and Machares for aid, and afterward
through Tigranes to Arsaces of Parthia.
