with Catiline in the field. But the state was utterly dis· 52
organized. In the first place, it was doubtful if the criminals
could be held for trial. They had been put under the care
of certain eminent men—Caesar and Crassus among them—
who were responsible for their safe keeping, but the freedmen
of the prisoners were stirring, Rome was full of desperadOeS,
the government had no efficient police or military force at
its disposal, and finally Catiline was close at hand. In the
second place, even if brought to trial, it was doubtful if they
could be convicted. The courts of Rome were notoriously
corrupt; if it was difficult to get a verdict against an influ-
ential man in an ordinary criminal case, in a political one it
would have been almost impossible. No one knew how far
the conspiracy extended-Caesar and Crassus were suspected,
though perhaps unjustly‚ of complicity in it--and the very
jurors selected to try the accused might have proved to be
their accompliceS. In the third place, granting that the 53
prisoners could be held for trial, and that a fair trial was pos-
sible, their punishment was a still more puzzling question.
Penal imprisonment had never been known at Rome, and the
death penalty, originally imposed by the people in full assern-
bly only, had ceased to be inflicted. In ordinary practice a
criminal who looked upon his conviction as certain was
allowed ‘to escape the theoretical punishment of death by
going into exile, but the courts no more imposed exile as a
penalty then than our courts today banish defaulterS.
The criminal‚ by a legal fiction, left his country of his own
accord and was merely forbidden ,to return. In the case
of Lentulus and his associates this voluntary exile would
have been farcical-they would simply have joined Catiline
to take up arms against the country. Such an act would have
been a confession of weakness almost fatal to the govern-
ment.
