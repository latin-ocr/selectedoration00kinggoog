acknowledged the first advocate of Rome.
The next year (69) he was aedile. The aedileship was not· 18

senile, a necessary step in a political career, but it carried with it

warh&

¹ the management of certain of the public gameS, and upon

these the aediles were expected and accustomed to spend
immense sums of their own money in the hope of gaining
popular favor. Such an expenditure was entirely beyond
Cicero's means; but the Sicilians had not forgotten his upright-

The measure was clearly unconstitutional, and as such was
vigorously opposed by the conservativeS. Resides, they
hated Pompey for. his own sake, because to him they owed
the loss of the courts and the re—establishment of the tribunate.
The bill was supported by Caesar and Cicero, by the latter,
