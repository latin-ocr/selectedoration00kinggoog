ORATIO IN

CATILINAM PRIMA

Tulli„ quid agis? Ti'ine eum, quem esse hostem :comperisti,

quem ducem belli futurum vides, quem expectari imperatorem·

in castris hostium sentis, auctorem sceleris, princi‘pem conisi-
rationis‚ evocatorem servorum et civium perditorum, exire

w patiere, ut abs te non emissus ex urbe, sed immissus in urbem

esse videatur? Nonne hunc in vincla duci, non ad mortem rapi,

non summo supplicio mactari imperabis? Quid tandem te 28

impedit? mosne maiorum? At persaepe etiam privati in hac

re pfiblioa perniciosos cives morte multarunt.
u de civium Romanorum supplicio rogatae· sunt? At numquam

An leges, quae

in hae urbe, qui ἕ. re publica defecerunt, civium isira tenuerunt.

An invidiam posteritatis times? Praeclaram vero populo

6. τιι-ιιοε-ἰα (subs. of patiere, l. 10) tors,' the unwritten constitution. to

plus the enclitic mark 01 interrogation.
comperisti: a word much affected by
Cicero (cf. omnia . . . comperi, 4. 23).
and ridiculed by his enemy, Clodius.

9. evocatorem servorum: After
the war with Spartacus the Romans
teared an insurrection of their slaves as
they searcd no other danger from within
or without. The conspirators laid great
stress upon the aid they would get from
this numerouS, strong and daring class
of men.

10. abs: This form of the preposi-
tion ab is found almost exclusively in
the phrase abs te. non omissus . . .
sed imminuat ‘not sent out ot . . .
but iet loose against! Note the play on
cognate words, as in exsul and consul
above. 10. 18. Ci'. the very similar ex-
pression in 0. 20· ut non dedus. . .
sed invitatus. ‚isse videam.

11-13. hunc. 0duci . ‚impe-
rabis: What is the construction of
phrases following iubeo and impero?
Cicero and Caesar use only the passive
infinitive with the latter verb. qum

. . impedit: The orator proceeds to
enumerate and answer three pleas which
might be made in defense of his inac-
tfion—(l) precedent.. (2) statute, (3)
ficar cf the hatred which would be
aso-sed by vigorous measures. mos
maiorum: ‘the custom or your ances-

which the Romans paid as much defer-
ence as to the written laws (hves, l. 14).
supply the ellipses with mos here, and
leves below. persaepe: an exaggera-
tion; Cicero gives but the one instance
of Nasica. and Gracchus. 1. 18.

14. morte: see A. 353: B. 208. 2. b:
H. 456, 3; H.-B. 428. It is substantialiy
an abl. of price. multarunt: (1)
‘fined;’ (2) ‘punished.' Trace the con-
nection. comparing note on 8. 8. lesen
Le.. the laws forbidding magistrates to
kill or scourge a citizen before he had
been tried and condemned by the peo-
ple. The earliest were the leves Va-
leriae (509, 449, 300), then the leves Por-
ciae. then the lea: Sempronia. owing te
the custom of permitting the accused to
anticipate conviction by going into exile
the infliction of capital punishment was
almost unknown.

15. rogatae. properly meaning pro-
posedss rarely as here means ‘Jpassed
numquam . . . iura tenuerunt·
Oicero here anticipates the argument.
already hinted at in his use of the word
hostis (5. 30). which he later used in the
fourth oration—that the conspirators
had forfeited their rights as citizens.
Sc. ii· as subi. oi mamni and ante-
cedent ol' qui.

lv. 18. Praeclaram retem gratiana
ironical—‘You make a fine return) On
