PREFAOE 5

(2<)·- As a rule cross references are made only to text or notes
preceding—backward, that is, not forward. (3) The· refer-
ences in the noteS‚ though very numerouS, are confined to the
Introduction, four Grammars in common use, Abbott's Roman
Political Institutione, and J ohnston's Private Life of the

centering his attention on the difficulties of language and style
the student is too apt to forget the larger purpose of the whole
argument. It is a good practice, therefore, for the teacher on

translation with the text before them. One of the Catiline
orations can be translated easily in less than forty minuteS.
Attention is called to the review of certain grammatical
points at the close of the notes on each chapter in the first two
orationS, and to the alphabetical index of grammatical refer-
ences on page 104, at the close of oration I, where the suggestion
is offered that the student be required or encouraged to make
