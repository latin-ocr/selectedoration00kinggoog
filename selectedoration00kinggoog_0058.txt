48 . INTRODUCTION

ius provocationis, · the lex Canuleia (445) the ius conubii, · and
the lex Licinia (367) gave them the right to hold the consul-
ship, and paved the way to unrestricted ius honorum by the
year 300.

Below the cives optimo iure came a numerous body, who 4
had either nevei· enjoyed full citizenship, or had lost it in
whole or in part. Of the former the most important class
were the freed slaves (Libertini), who stood to their former
masters much as in earlier times the clients had stood to the
patricians. They were enrolled as cive-3, held property and
voted‚ but were practically denied the ius honorum until the
taint of their origin had been removed by several generations,

There were several ways in which a citizen might lose some 5
or all of his civitas, Conviction for certain offenses (infamia),
or going into exile to avoid condemnation on a capital charge,
involved the loss of certain iura for life; while the censure of
the Censors (iynominia) took away certain rights during their
term of office. Citizenship was altogether lost by the citizen's
transferring his allegiance to another state, or by his being taken
captive in war and sold by the enemy into slavery; though
in the latter case he recovered his rights (by what was called
postliminium) on the recovery of his freedom by escape or ’
release.

 

From the standpoint of a magistrate each citizen was a 6 ,

caput, a political unit, and the loss of citizenship to a less or
greater extent was called Deminutio Capitis. Hence such
expressions as crimen capitale, iudicium capiti-3, poena capitis,
do not mean a charge, trial or punishment in which the life
· of a citizen was at stake, but such a one as involved the whole
or partial loss of his civitas, It is very important to remember
this when reading of Roman courts.

Citizenship was acquired by birth in lawful wedlock of parents 7
having the ius conubii, or was conferred by law, or was (rarely)
given by some duly authorized magistrate. A citizen born
was enrolled as such on reaching his seventeenth year, taking
